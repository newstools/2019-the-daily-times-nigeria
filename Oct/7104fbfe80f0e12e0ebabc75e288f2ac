The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that: ‘no amount of apologies, intimidations, violence, vote buying and “body bag” metaphor can change or save Governor Yahaya Bello from defeat in the November 16 governorship election. The PDP  said Nasir el-Rufai, who is Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Kogi state National Campaign Council,   must have realized that whatever his party, the APC, perpetuated in Kaduna state in the 2019 general elections can no longer be replayed, Police recover N10m from kidnap gang, arrest 81 suspectsPDP advised Governor Rufai to steer clear of the state as the people abhor incitements and threats in the November 16 governorship election. Kola Ologbondiyan PDP’s National Publicity Secretary said the the people of Kogi state are already aware of individuals in the  for issuing threats as well as the “body bag” metaphor and will never allow such incitements to pervade the November election.The PDP  said Governor Rufai must have realized that whatever his party, the APC, perpetuated in Kaduna state in the 2019 general elections can no longer be replayed, not even in Kaduna state or any other state of the federation, not to talk of Kogi state, with its long standing history of tough resistance to forceful occupation and control. Rufai therefore should not bother to lead a failed team of an expansionist force into a lost battle. He should rather use the opportunity to counsel Governor Yahaya Bello to accept his rejection by the people of Kogi state and be ready to face the burden of a crushing defeat on November 16.The APC knows that Governor Bello has gone down in history as the worst governor ever in Nigeria; who cannot point to any development project or initiative in governance and under whom a once vibrant and productive state has been reduced to the poorest and most dejected in our country.If the APC means well for Kogi state, the party should not be wasting its time to  rather counsel Yahaya Bello to use the remaining days of his abysmal tenure to show remorse, pay up the 36   owes workers and pensioners,   those who died because of his suppressive rule and get ready with his handover notes.The APC Campaign Council should come to terms with the fact that the people of Kogi state had made up their minds to repay Yahaya Bello in his own coin by kicking him out of office. Therefore, no amount of apologies, intimidations, violence, vote buying and “body bag” metaphor can change their or save Governor Bello from defeat in this election.
