The judge gave the order following an ex parte motion filed by the EFCC EFCC’s motion was supported by a 30-paragraph affidavit which it brought pursuant to section 17 of Anti-money Laundering Act. Maina is accused of being involved in pension fraud running into over N100 billion. The Federal Civil Service Commission dismissed him in 2013 for “absconding from duty” but he returned to the country in 2017 and was reinstated as a director in the interior ministry. Following outrage, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered his dismissal and demanded a probe of his recall. (NAN)
