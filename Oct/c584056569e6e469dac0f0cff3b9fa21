Manchester United are now unbeaten in their last seven home games against Liverpool, whose lead over second-placed Manchester City is cut to six points. Rashford scored after turning home a superb low cross from Dan James after the speedy Welshman had broken down the right flank. The goal was subject to a video review and allowed to stand in spite of Liverpool claims that Victor Lindelof had fouled Divock Origi at the start of the move. Liverpool thought they had got level, two minutes before the interval, when Sadio Mane outfought Lindelof and poked home but the VAR review showed the Senegalese forward had handled the ball.
