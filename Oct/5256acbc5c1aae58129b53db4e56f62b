President Nuhari is expected to lay the 2020 budget before a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives on Oct. 8 for approval, “as the country intends to revert to the January to December budget cycle.’’ The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the early presentation of the 2020 budget is meant to return the Federal Government budget cycle from May-June to January-December. The Senate had on Thursday increased the proposed 2020 budget from N10.007 billion  to N10.729trillion. However, President Buhari and the leadership of the National Assembly had on Sunday night (Oct. 6) met behind closed doors at the President’s official residence in Abuja in what appeared to be `2020 budget reconciliation meeting’.(NAN)
