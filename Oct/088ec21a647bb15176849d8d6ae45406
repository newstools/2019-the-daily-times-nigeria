News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the tribunal on September 21, dismissed all three petitions challenging the state’s governorship election where Ihedioha emerged as winner. The petitioners challenged the emergence of the PDP candidate as winner of the March 9 governorship election on the grounds that the election was marred with irregularities. However the tribunal held that candidate of the Action Alliance, Uche Nwosu, Ifeanyi Ararume of the All Progressives Grand Alliance and Senator Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress, failed to establish their petitions against Ihedioha. The three-man tribunal held that the petitioners having failed to discharge the burden of proof placed on them by the law, their petitions were liable to be dismissed. Earlier, the Action Alliance party on September 7, during its special convention, withdrew the party’s name from the election tribunal, saying it was for the overall interests of the party and the state.
