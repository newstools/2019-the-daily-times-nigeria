Saraki said In 2016, my colleagues & I in the 8th Senate passed the “Sexual Harassment in Tertiary Education Institution Prohibition Bill” to prescribe a 5-year jail term for any lecturer, educationist or person in a position of authority in any tertiary institution in Nigeria found guilty of such conduct. Pastor, UNILAG don exposed in sex for mark scandal I appeal to the 9th Senate & President Buhari to revisit this Bill so that we can implement the institutional reforms necessary to safeguard our children in educational institutions in the country. I also urge the institutions to conduct robust investigations not only on the accused but also for all other reports and complaints that come in. We need to believe victims and make institutions safer for our students.
