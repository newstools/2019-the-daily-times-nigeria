She said that the aim of the summit was to create awareness on the need for people, especially women, to go for cancer screening, at least once in a year. Aliyu also said that the conference was intended to bring to the consciousness of the government, whose primary responsibility was to ensure the overall wellbeing of the citizens, the need to tackle the disease headlong. She expressed hope that deliberations and recommendations from the summit would contribute in no small measures towards eradicating cancer through regular and constant awareness campaign.
