A Syrian journalist and media expert, Mohamad Rasheed, has tweeted a video of what he claims to be the bombing of the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Abū Bakr al-Baghdadi. Al-Baghdadi was reported dead on Sunday as American troops bombarded his hideout in Barisha village of Idlib northern countryside near the Syrian-Turkish border. Rasheed, who tweets in Arabic, had tweeted [as translated by Google Translate]: “Video from the site targeted by US military forces at dawn today in Barisha village of Idlib northern countryside near the Syrian-Turkish border.” See the video as tweeted by Rasheed via his Twitter handle @mohmad_rasheed:
