Both NNPC and Lukoil, according to the presidential aide, will work towards the prospect of oil in deep offshore. “The issue of uncompleted and abandoned Ajaokuta Steel Rolling Mill was presented by President Buhari. “His request for the return of Russia, on a government-to-government relationship, for completion and commissioning of the plant was accepted by President Putin,’’ he further revealed. The presidential aide also disclosed that the Russian Government had agreed to support development of Nigeria’s rail infrastructure by constructing 1,400 kilometres track from Lagos to the South-South city of Calabar. At the plenary of the Russia – Africa summit on Thursday, President Buhari pledged to inject fresh energy into Nigeria-Russia relations to bolster an age-long relationship that had been mutually rewarding and promising. The President called for a stronger partnership that is humane, inclusive and diversified. Also on Oct. 24, Nigeria and Russia signed an important Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which would enable both countries’ oil giants, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and Russia’s Lukeoil to elevate commercial relationship to a government-to-government backed partnership. Shehu said that with the signing of the MoU, NNPC and Lukeoil would work together in upstream operations and revamp Nigeria’s refineries. According to him, the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mele Kyari and Vagit Alekperov, President of leading Russian oil company, Lukeoil, signed the MoU, which entailed cooperation in deep offshore exploration of oil in Nigeria, production, trading and refining.
