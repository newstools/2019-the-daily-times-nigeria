The deputy controller said that Niger being the zone’s headquarters, it needed to be adequately equipped in order to complement the efforts of the state fire service in the event of fire outbreaks and other emergencies. He said that Suleja was a flash point, hence the need for a befitting fire station with fire engines and other fire-fighting appliances to prevent and fight fires in emergencies. Clement thanked the Niger government for providing the service with a temporary office accommodation, and commended the Niger State Fire Service for the cooperation it had enjoyed since the creation of the zonal headquarters in the state.
