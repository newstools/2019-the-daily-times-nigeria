Nigerian are reacting to yesterday’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) raid of  Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office in Gusau and the carting away of four ‘Ghana-must-go’ bags suspected to contain money from the Zamfara office of INEC. Here are some tweets from Twitter: If you ask me , I'll say EFCC should be president and not APC, they're the ones fighting corruption here..EFCC for president. @wealthdjoy “Use it to either palliate some of the d bad roads in that community or better still provide the villagers with potable water. Thanks.” God bless You,👍 Nigeria must be great. God bless You,👍 Nigeria must be great. @nvwole “The perpetrators will also join mouth and complain that the economy is bad. Some of you evil people deserve firing squad.” @mohd_ks “Pay the ad-hoc staff their money first then remit whatever that will be left to govt.” @Kabadiz “This is not bribe money..but money meant for ad hoc but they won’t pay them. There are many here in my state also.” @TundeA01 “People are wicked in this country.
