Banjo Kamiludeen, the national coach of Nigeria Deaf Football Association (NDFA), has called for reward for the Deaf Eagles, runners-up at the just-concluded West Africa Deaf Football (WADFU) Tournament. Mali defeated Nigeria 1-0 in the final match of the tournament held in Sierra-Leone.

In all their outings at the tournament, Nigeria stood out in the continent and beyond,” Kamiludeen said on Saturday. He said the deaf footballers were hopeful that their efforts in the tournament would attract meaningful reward from the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development. The coach said the reward was necessary as it would go a long way to motivate the footballers to remain in the sport and target winning the main trophy at subsequent editions.
