Abuja – The President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan, on Monday said it was share misrepresentation of fact to say that newsmen were not allowed to cover the budget defence sessions going on at the National Assembly. Lawn, in a statement by his Spokesperson, Mr Ola Awoniyi, was reacting to reports published in some dailies recently that the media were shut out of the coverage of the budget  at the various senate committees.“There is no shut out of the press from what we do.“We need the press to tell Nigerians what we are doing. You (journalists) are our friends. That was a misunderstanding of what happened,” Lawan said.
