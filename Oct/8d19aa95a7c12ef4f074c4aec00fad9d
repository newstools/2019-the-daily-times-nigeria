The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has announced the discovery of oil in the north-eastern part of the country. Acting Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Samson Makoji announced this in a statement on Friday. He said the discovery of oil and gas in commercial quantity in the Gongola Basin will “attract foreign investment, generate employment for people to earn income and increase government revenues”. The NNPC statement said NNPC acquired 435.54km2 of 3D Seismic Data over Kolmani Prospect in the Upper Benue Trough, Gongola Basin. This, it said, was to evaluate Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company, SNEPCo, Kolmani River 1 Well Discovery of 33 BCF and explore deeper levels.Makoji said the well was drilled with “IKENGA RIG 101” to a total depth of 13,701feet encountering oil and gas in several levels, adding that a Drill Stem Test (DST) is currently on-going to confirm the commercial viability and flow of the Kolmani River reservoirs.

The NNPC plans to drill additional wells for full evaluation of the hydrocarbon volume in the Gongola Basin.” Makoji noted that during the spud-in ceremony of Kolmani River II, President Muhammadu stated the commitment of his administration to the exploration for oil and gas in the frontier basins in the entire length and breadth of the country. The basins include: the Benue Trough, Chad Basin, Sokoto and Bida Basins.”He also stated that attention would be given to the Dahomey and Anambra Basins which have already witnessed oil and gas discoveries.The discovery of oil and gas in commercial quantity in the Gongola Basin will attract foreign investment, generate employment for people to earn income and increase government revenues.”
