The Federal Ministry of Women Affairs has budgeted N360m for the “specialised education programme” of the Chibok girls rescued by the Federal Government. The information is contained in the 2020 budget proposal which was submitted by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly last Tuesday. This implies that N3.3m was budgeted for each of the rescued 106 schoolgirls. According to the Punch, the 106 schoolgirls are currently attending the American University of Nigeria, Yola, founded by former Vice-President and Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate in the last election, Atiku Abubakar. The N360m budgeted for the education of the Chibok girls constitutes about 9 per cent of the ministry headquarters’ N3.9bn budget for the year 2020. The ministry also budgeted N60m for the psycho-social support services of internally displaced persons and ex-militants, orphans and vulnerable children.
