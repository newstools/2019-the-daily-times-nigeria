A wildlife official, on Thursday, said a wild tiger has killed a 48-year-old woman, who was collecting fodder for her cattle near a national park in south-western Nepal. Apa Baral, Chief Conservation Officer of Bardia National Park, said the woman was rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors declared her dead later. Baral said that the woman suffered injuries on her head, hands and face. In August, wild tigers killed two people near the national park. Baral said shrinking of the endangered animal’s habitat and an increase in human activities near the protected area were causing the attacks by wild animals. He said wildlife and security officials were tracking the movements of the tiger in the area. “We will decide on whether to capture it after analysing the footage from camera traps,’’ Baral said. Nepal is home to 235 endangered wild tigers that live in protected areas in the country’s southern plains along the border with India. (dpa/NAN)
