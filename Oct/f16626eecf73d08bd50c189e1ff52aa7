The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the Buhari Presidency as the den of thieves following the arrest of an alleged scammer, Abdurauf Illyasu, said to be linked to President Muhammadu Buhari. The party said that the shocking fact that the scammer, Abdulrauf Illyasu, even enjoys an office accommodation within the safety and cover of the Presidential Villa, from where he carries out his fraudulent assignments, is hard evidence that the Buhari Presidency breeds and facilitates swindlers, charlatans and treasury looters. PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement, however, noted that nothing is impossible in a Presidency “replete with persons who thrive in lies, false claims, certificate forgery, bribery, intimidation and recruiting of fraudulent and corrupt persons as ministers, special advisers and clandestine fronts for financial sleazes. “Our party holds that it is the height of deceit and duplicity that an administration that boasts of integrity and zero tolerance for corruption can be the very sanctuary of the underworld. “Only last week, a known confidant of Mr. President, Nasir Danu, was arrested at Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom for alleged international passport scam and money laundering while allegedly ferrying stolen currencies for persons said to be close to the Presidency. “This is in addition to further allegations that Danu has been fronting for a close relation of the President for shady oil deals and huge contracts running into billions of naira in major revenue earning agencies.” The PDP invited Nigerians to note how the Abdulrauf Illyasu and Danu matters remind of the case of the former aide to the first lady, Mr. Baba-Inna, who was earlier arrested over accusations of receiving billions of naira from politicians and businessmen on behalf of the first lady. The party also urged Nigerians to recall the confession of one Amina Mohammed, who while being paraded by the Department of State Services (DSS) in 2018, stated in public that persons close to President Buhari were involved in serial fraud and looting of public resources under the cover of the some elements in the Presidency.
