Hong Kong’s government has formally withdrawn a controversial extradition bill that sparked months of mass protests. The Legislative Council completed the process on Wednesday afternoon. The Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which would have allowed residents to be extradited to mainland China to stand trial, saw its second reading in the legislature on Wednesday. It was then withdrawn by Secretary for Security John Lee. The legislative action follows an announcement by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam in September that the bill would be withdrawn after she earlier suspended it.

Protests are expected to continue even after the bill’s formal demise as the protest movement has escalated to include demands for democratic reform and an inquiry into police violence against protesters.
