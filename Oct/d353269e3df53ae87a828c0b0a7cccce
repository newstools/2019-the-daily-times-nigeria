The minister made the pledge when officials of the National Youth Games (NYG) and Nigerian Tulip International School in Abuja paid him a courtesy visit. He said his ministry would be working closely with the Federal Ministry of Education to repackage and re-launch the two competitions as part of plans to mix sports and education, especially at the grassroots. “The competition will involve primary and secondary schools across the country with the aim to grow and nurture a new generation of athletes that will take over from the older ones.’’ Teacher allegedly rapes JSS1 student in Benue The minister also said arrangements had been concluded with some private schools to sponsor athletes recently discovered at the 5th NYG held in Ilorin in September. “Nigerian Tulip International School is partnering with the ministry to give the athletes 100 per cent scholarship for their secondary school education,” he said.
