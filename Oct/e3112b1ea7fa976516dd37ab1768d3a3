The Nigerian Film Corporation (NFC) and the Nigerian Military have decried the wrong portrayal of the military in Nigerian movies, saying it is undermining the military’s enormous sacrifices and its personnel. The Head, Public Relations, of the corporation, Mr Brian Etuk, said in a statement issued to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)  on Monday in Jos that there was an urgent need to address the abnormality. “Both institutions have resolved to embark on joint stakeholder engagements that will lead to the provision of research, equipment and personnel support to independent film makers who undertake the production of Nigerian military related films,” Etuk said. He said in line with that, the Nigerian Armed Forces would collaborate with NFC in the production of television and film series that would showcase the numerous national, regional and global successes of its personnel in contributing toward peace and security.
