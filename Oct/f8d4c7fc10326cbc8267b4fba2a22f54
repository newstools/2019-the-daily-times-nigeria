Gustav Gerneth, the person believed to be the oldest man in Germany on Tuesday celebrated his 114th birthday. Mayor Bernd Poloski visited Gerneth at his home in the north-eastern town of Havelberg, bringing him best wishes from politicians, a gift hamper with Gerneth’s favourite candy and flowers. “He still likes to eat sweets,’’ Poloski said afterwards. As in previous years, Gerneth spent his birthday only with a small group of people. The celebration also featured a Frankfurter Kranz, a ring-shaped buttercream cake. “He is still interested in things, especially in football,’’ Poloski said. Gerneth is a trained machine operator and was born on October 15, 1905, in what is now the Polish city of Szczecin. NAN.
