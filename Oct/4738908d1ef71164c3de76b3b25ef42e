The prize, worth nine million Swedish crowns (about £730,000; $900,000), will be awarded in Oslo in December. After becoming prime minister in April 2018, Mr Abiy introduced massive liberalising reforms to Ethiopia, shaking up what was an extremely tightly controlled nation. He freed thousands of opposition activists from jail and allowed exiled dissidents to return home. Most importantly, he signed a peace deal with Ethiopia’s neighbour Eritrea, ending a two-decade conflict. But his reforms also lifted the lid on Ethiopia’s ethnic tensions, and the resulting violence forced some 2.5 million people from their homes.

He remains chairman of both the ruling EPRDF (Ethiopian
People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front) and the ODP (Oromo Democratic Party)
(which is one of the four coalition parties of the EPRDF) A former army intelligence officer, Abiy, since becoming
prime minister, has launched a wide programme of political and economic
reforms, not all of which have met with favour by supporters of the
federalism-based constitution/system of Ethiopia and in Tigray.
