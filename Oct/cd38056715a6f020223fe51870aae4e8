Thirty Mile Zone (TMZ), an online tabloid news website, reports that while Nicki and Kenneth were at the marriage registry back in August 2019, she agreed to change her name from Onika Tanya Maraj to Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty. Apparently, Nicki Minaj got married to Petty on Monday, Oct. 21, in a secret ceremony because the media was kept in the dark.
