Inga explained that the flood, which began in August as a result of a localised high intensity rainfall accompanied by torrential winds, triggered massive run off activities in streams, rivers and drainage in urban and rural areas. “The flood killed five people in Ketso community, a child in Kontagora town and a 7-year year-old Khadijat Aliyu in Fadipe areas of the state. “Also, a father and his three sons lost their lives in Edati, three primary pupils in Gurara, three children in Yuna village of Borgu Local Government Areas of the state,” he said. The director general added that farmlands were destroyed as well as roads, bridges and culverts during the flood disaster. He said that the combine effect of the micro climate trend and sever rainfall regime upstream of river Niger and Kaduna increased inflow in the basin, which resulted in the spillage of the water from the three hydro power dams.
