The EFCC boss was nominated  came by the Head of Mission, Border Management and Migration, ECOWAS, at the end of a two-day workshop on “Capitalization and Sharing of Good Practices on Promoting Regular Migration and Fighting Border Corruption,” organised by Niger Republic’s High Authority against Corruption and Assimilated Offenses, HALCIA, in Abuja on Thursday. Magu, while accepting the leadership role, commended the organisers for putting up a successful event of high standard, declaring that the EFCC will live up to the expectation in the responsibility, given to it by the ECOWAS member states.
