LASEMA raises alarm over pipeline vadalism in Kakatin, a Lagos suburb “Grudges amongst musicians is not healthy for our industry and will only create further resentment in their relationships as musicians and may affect what we represent or present to the public. “Being emotionally immature when composing or writing your songs means you can not control your emotions or reactions towards your colleagues. “Having quarrel is a fact of life amongst best of friends but you don’t take it too hard on yourselves because it might graduate to what happened in the case of 2pac and Biggie. “I advise we settle our differences internally if we have any, rather than taking them to the studio and then streets/homes. That doesn’t project us in good light,” he said.
