The wife of the Enugu State Governor, Mrs. Monica Ugwuanyi, Wednesday, advised women to be cautious of their health by engaging in regular medical check-up and routine exercises. Mrs. Ugwuanyi enjoined women to join in the cancer awareness campaign, while also advising them to undertake regular breast checks to ascertain their medical status in order to nip the deadly disease in the bud. Addressing women in Enugu State during the monthly prayer rally held at Michael Okpara Square, Enugu, Mrs. Ugwuanyi noted that this month’s event was dedicated to create awareness of cancer and campaign against it. She pointed out that early detection of cancer is the best way to tackle the disease and urged the women to disseminate the information to their loved ones and other people in their neighborhoods. Mrs. Ugwuanyi maintained that the monthly prayer session has remained a veritable platform to identify with God and offer prayers for the state as well as “put similes on the faces of people” through worthy advice, assistance and presentation of gift items.
