The Nigeria Association of Petroleum Explorationists (NAPE) has condemned the fall in crude oil price at the international market. Addressing journalists in Lagos ahead of his association 37th Annual International Conference and Exhibition, the National President, Ajibola Oyebamiji stated that the association observed that the low oil price regime has led to dwindling reserves, more burdens on foreign reserves, pressure on infrastructure and social services, inability to meet commitments to institutional lenders. “Crude oil price was selling at $81.03 per barrel in October 2018 but fell to $58.09 per barrels as at 16th October 2019. This represents over 28 per cent decline in one year and the long contracting cycle results in high levels of uncertainties in costing and planning, thereby creating a sluggish business climate,” he lamented.
