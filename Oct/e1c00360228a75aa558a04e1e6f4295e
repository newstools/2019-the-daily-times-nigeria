Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus. This virus spreads from person-to-person by direct contact or through the air from an infected person’s coughing or sneezing. A person with chickenpox is generally contagious one to two days before the rash appears and until all the blisters have formed scabs, according to the health department.
