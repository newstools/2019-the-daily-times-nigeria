Mnay customers of one of Nigeriaâ€™s bank Access Bank have taken to Twitter on Thursday to decry what some  describe as bad service. Below are some of the tweets from Access Bankâ€™s customers Access Bank that has been playing with my brain since, sometimes I got debit alert twice of my PiggyVest. Mobile app is the worst. I donâ€™t even get credit/ debit alert at appropriate time again, na when dy get time or make them no even send itâ€¦.  #Accessbank Access Bank keeps getting worse everyday! From irregular debits to excess charges and from bad customer service to malfunctioning ATMs. How did this once promising bank I always praised get this bad? The merger with Diamond? Maybe. Maybe not.#AccessBank you need to fix things. We always hear of so-called system failure from the customers' end, but not so much of it when it comes to banks taking their charges. #Accessbank When waking up to see #Accessbank trending and remembering what they put me through last three months pic.twitter.com/O9WNIdso6o When you see this repeatedly shitty bank trending again but you're safe because you don't bank with themâ€¦ #Accessbank pic.twitter.com/Ivrz4oXzu6 Today makes it 1week 4days they promised to send the card to ojota branch Yet the card still dey ikorodu branch â€¦.God will punish people in this Country #Accessbank #Accessbank @twitymania has been asking Access Bank @accessbank_help to fix the challenge with a failed transaction of N80, 000.
