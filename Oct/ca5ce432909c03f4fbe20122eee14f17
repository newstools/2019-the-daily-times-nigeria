Nobel laurete, Prof Wole Soyinka, has said that Nigeria’s education was nothing to write home about, saying ‘We are in serious trouble, education wise in this country’ Soyinka said this on Sunday at the University of Lagos, Akoka, during the presentation of a play, ‘Folly of Men.’ which was part of the activities in marking  the 90th anniversary of the Government College, Ibadan. The play was an adaptation of three plays: Wole Soyinka’s ‘Trial of Brother Jero;’ Femi Osofisan’s ‘No More the Wasted Breed;’ and Bode Sowande’s ‘Mamiwater’s Wedding.’ Soyinka said the country’s education was nothing to write home about. Your moves to gag media, freedom of speech obnoxious, anti-democratic PDP tells Buhari “We are in serious trouble, education wise in this country. Let me not kid you; it’s horrifying. That was why I was happy about the initiative of creating a model school and trying to resurrect this Government College and present it as the ideal. We are really very low, education wise. “I have learnt how much they (old students association) have done in the last few days and I am very proud of their work. I just hope the government leaves them alone; don’t interfere with them. Let them bring back to everybody’s mind the possibility of what education can be,” the renowned writer said. Also Mr Femi  said, “What pains us now is that the school (Government College Ibadan) could produce people of worth before, but the whole thing has gone down now. We are hoping that this help generate new impetus and action about the school and education.”
