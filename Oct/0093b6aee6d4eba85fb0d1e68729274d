He said that “whatever you have is as a result of providence; whatever position that you are occupying, it is not because you have worked so much for it, it is as a result of divine favour, so give Him thanks.” The cleric said that all have sinned and urged that people should always seek for forgiveness and avoid condemning others because Jesus shed His blood for sinners. The thanksgiving service was attended by political office holders and leaders, community leaders and traditional rulers.
