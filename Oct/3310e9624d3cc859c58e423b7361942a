I am sure they will turn up next time we decide to put a price. “This is something I do all the time; it is not like giving back to the society; I just feel it is the right thing to do. Once you are on a certain level in your field, you must hold others by the hand. “Everyone knows I do this all the time. In fact, the whole of 2016, we were doing comedy night like a platform totally for upcoming talents. “True, they can also make use of the social media but in stand-up comedy, you need to explore beyond the social media. You will always need to stand before an audience and that is the platform which I create,” he said. Koffi urged the government and artistes who have made it `big’ in the entertainment industry to support young talents. According to him, Nigeria’s entertainment industry is lucrative enough to reduce unemployment if adequate support is got from private and public sectors. (NAN)
