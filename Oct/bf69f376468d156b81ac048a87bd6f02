You will all agree that Good Governance, Inclusive Growth and Collective Prosperity can only be sustained in an environment of peace and security. “Our fiscal reforms shall introduce new performance management frameworks to regulate the cost to revenue ratios for Government-Owned Enterprises, which shall come under significant scrutiny. We will reward exceptional revenue and cost management performance, while severe consequences will attend failures to achieve agreed revenue targets.” Mr President also expressed optimism that the “increasing share of non-oil revenues underscores our confidence in our revenue diversification strategies, going forward. Furthermore, in our efforts to enhance transparency and accountability, we shall continue our strict implementation of Treasury Single Account (TSA) to capture the domiciliary accounts in our foreign missions and those linked to Government-Owned Enterprises.” To this end, President Buhari reiterated his administration’s resolve towards aggressive and re-energised revenue drive will maintain the debt-revenue ratio at acceptable and manageable levels, through the adoption of innovative borrowings instruments such as Sukuk, Green Bonds and Diaspora Bonds.

The continuous recovery reflects our economy’s resilience and gives credence to the effectiveness of our economic policies thus far.
