He said that the framework was developed as a result of the incessant failure of IT projects carried out within MDAs. The director-general said that the y, in recent years, was working on regulations for easy service delivery which includes public sector consumer protection. “Consumer protection is a win-win situation for consumers and providers. The consumer should be able to have access to correct and unbiased information about the products and services they purchase. “This will enable them make informed choices based on their needs and help them to avoid being mistreated or misled by the seller or service providers. “NITDA, therefore, needs to protect the users of information technology products against substandard IT products and services in Nigeria,” he said. He also said that objectives of the forum would also provide solutions to identify IT problems in MDAs, protect and safeguard their rights and interests in the IT industry. Abdullahi urged the participants at the forum to make relevant contributions toward a workable SLA and consumer protection in the public sector. (NAN)
