According to him, some lower court judges begin sittings in their courts by 11.00 am instead of the official time of 9.00am“We cannot tolerate any judge of the lower court commencing sittings late perpetually. “If for a good reason a judge sit late, it would be understood, but to sit late perpetually, it cannot be allowed to continue,” he added. Dikko said that the leadership of the judiciary in the state had received reports on the activities of those judges giving it a bad name. He said that the judiciary would set up machinery to investigate the allegations. Dikko said that if the high court judges could sit by 9.00am, there was no reason why the judges of the lower courts should be an exception.
