A former Yahoo software engineer,
Reyes Daniel Ruiz has pleaded guilty to charges of illegally accessing user
accounts. Reyes Daniel Ruiz
admitted he had “hacked” about 6,000 accounts, seeking sexual images
and videos, saying he used access to Yahoo accounts to target other online
services users had signed up for. In a statement, the US
Department of Justice said Ruiz had “cracked” user passwords and
accessed internal Yahoo systems while hunting for pornography. The Department of
Justice said the access Ruiz had attained to Yahoo user data had helped him
“compromise” Apple iCloud, Facebook, GMail, Dropbox and other online
accounts. And he had used his
access to the accounts to reset passwords so he could access the other systems. Ruiz had targeted
friends, co-workers and many young women during his hacking campaign, the DoJ
said. He had also copied many
of the images and videos he had found and kept the material at his home. However, when Yahoo learnt
of his activities, in 2018, the ex-engineer had destroyed the computer and hard
drives on which the stolen data had been stored. Again, Ruiz was charged
in April this year and has now signed an agreement with the Department of Justice
which will see him pleading guilty to one count of computer intrusion. He is due to be
sentenced in February 2020. The maximum jail term for computer intrusion is
five years plus a fine of $250,000 (N90,375,000.00) and damages.
