Sheffield (UK) – Lys Mousset’s first half strike earned Sheffield United a 1-0 English Premier League (EPL) win over Arsenal at Bramall Lane on Monday to end the Gunners’ eight-match unbeaten run. Unai Emery’s side had not been beaten in any competition since their 3-1 loss to Liverpool on Aug 24, but they missed out on the chance to move up to third as the hosts earned a deserved victory. Mousset poked home the winner from close range on 30 minutes after Nicolas Pepe wasted a gilt-edged chance for Arsenal earlier in the first half.
