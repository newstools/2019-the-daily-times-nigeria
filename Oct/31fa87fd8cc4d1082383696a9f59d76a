The Federal government through the Ministry of
Communications (FMC) has warned security agencies to stop the wrongful
profiling of young Nigerians with computing devices like laptops, among others. In a statement by the minister of Communications, Isa
Pantami and signed by the spokesperson, Uwa Suleiman, the minister admonished
security agencies to be circumspect and exercise restraint from such. Patami, stated that if this trend goes unchecked, it will
dampen the vigorous attempt at diversifying the economy and push more young
energies underground with catastrophic consequences. The minister stated, “The attention of the Federal Ministry
of Communications (FMC), has been drawn to reports of widespread harassment of
young Nigerians with personal computers, tablets or phablets in public places. “These reports indicate that young persons are generally
regarded as fraudsters by officers of security agencies if found with such
devices in their possession and subsequently subjected to varied forms of
harassment and in some cases outright extortion. “The Ministry notes with dismay, this unfortunate turn of
events as we celebrate the growing and bubbling technology eco-system in
Nigeria that enables young persons to learn various skills ranging from
software engineering to varied forms of entrepreneurship by simply accessing
online tools and content on these devices.” Patami who noted that the Ministry is aware that several
other persons engage in disreputable activities using computers and similar
devices, however, caution must be applied so as not to paint all young Nigerians
with a similar brush. They also applauded the efforts of some law enforcement
agencies, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), in
intelligence gathering and subsequent apprehension of these unscrupulous
elements who use computing systems to commit cybercrimes. The Federal Ministry of Communications said it is committed
to working closely with parastatals including the National Information
Technology Development Agencies (NITDA), Nigerian Communications Commission
(NCC) and relevant security agencies, Hubs and all groups promoting digital
capacity building in Nigeria to ensure that such incidents are completely
eliminated and that all hands are on deck to promote the growth of a healthy
eco-system supportive of young Nigerians and creating opportunities to harness
their energies.
