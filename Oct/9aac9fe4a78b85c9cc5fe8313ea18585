.Warns against uncertainty surrounding global economy weakness .As Nigeria’s inflation hits 11.24% in September 2019 Channel Kogi’s N10bn through workers, not Bello, PDP tells NASS The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slashed global economy growth forecast in its October 2019 World Economic Outlook (WEO). This is just as the National Bureau of Statistics  (NBS) has said Consumer Price Index (CPI) which measures inflation increased by 11.24 per cent (year-on-year) in September 2019. The IMF, however, pointed out that continuing trade conflicts in the longer term could also hurt global demand in oil, thus pushing the benchmark price lower which in effect would cause a contraction in Nigeria’s economic growth as the country is heavily dependent on oil exports. The report revealed that the global growth estimate for 2019 was as high as 3.9per cent in mid-2018. However, economic momentum and weaker investment led to the slashing of the estimated growth as it reached a near standstill pace of 1.1% from 3.6% last year, though it also sees a pickup to 3.2 per cent in 2020. This downward revision can be attributed to a number of factors such as continuing trade conflicts that have undercut business confidence and investment. The IMF made it known that the trade policies of the United States President, Donald Trump is currently one of the biggest global threats as investors await clarity on the possibility that the U.S.-China talks will ease global uncertainties. According to the IMF Chief Economist, Gita Gopinath, the global economy is experiencing “a synchronized slowdown and uncertain recovery. There is no room for policy mistakes and an urgent need for policymakers to cooperatively de-escalate trade and geopolitical tensions.” Gopinath said. Meanwhile, the NBS in its latest report stated that the 0.22 per cent increase in the nation’s inflation for September was higher than the 11.02 per cent recorded in August 2019.
