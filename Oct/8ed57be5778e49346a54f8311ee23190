The Federal Government has revealed its plans to re- introduce toll gates on federal highways. The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola confirmed this to newsmen  after the Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting presided over by President Buhari on Wednesday. Fashola, who was with  the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed said there was no law that banned government from having toll gate on federal roads. Adding that,“There is no reason why we can’t toll, there was a policy of the government to abolish tolls or as it were, dismantle toll plaza but there is no law that prohibits tolling in Nigeria today. “We expect to return toll plazas, We have concluded their designs of what they will look like, what materials they will be rebuilt with, what new considerations must go into them. What we are looking at now and trying to conclude is how the bank end runs.” He said. He also said that the government was also considering to eliminate the payment of cash by introducing electronic mode of payment. Fashola further disclosed that government planned to acquire more lands to expand the width of the toll gates as it proposed to have a ten-lane.
