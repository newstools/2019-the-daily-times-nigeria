Former Inter Milan coach Stefano Pioli has been appointed coach of city rivals AC Milan. The Italian club confirmed on Wednesday. Pioli, who most recently coached Fiorentina, takes over after Marco Giampaolo was sacked Tuesday after four defeats in the first seven league games this season including a 2-0 derby loss to Inter. The former 18-time Italian champions, who won their last Serie A title in 2011, are in 13th position just three points above the relegation zone. On 11 September 2007, Pioli was unveiled as new head coach of Serie B club Grosseto, replacing Giorgio Roselli, who was sacked after three consecutive defeats in the first three league matches, and managed to lead the Tuscan minnows to an impressive mid-table finish in their first season in the Serie B. He then served as head coach of Piacenza for their 2008–09 Serie B campaign. In July 2009, he left Piacenza to join Sassuolo as new head coach of the neroverdi.
