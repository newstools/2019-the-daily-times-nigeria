The psychologist further urged mothers to spend quality time in raising their girl-children, adding that the duty of raising a child was beyond house help and the contributions of relatives. “Lack of good parental skills among mothers has been described as a major reason responsible for the increased cases of teenage pregnancy, rape and defilement among adolescent girls,” she said. Dim also advised them to be resourceful, modesty, live exemplary life and be teachers to every child around them.
