Usain Bolt there’s a new World Championships record holder, and her name is Allyson Felix. USA Olympic sprinter Felix broke Bolt’s record Sunday after winning her 12th gold medal at the World Championships on the mixed-gender 4x400m relay team.

Felix is already one of the most decorated track and field athletes, winning a combined nine medals between each of her four Olympic games. Six of the medals are gold. Felix summed up her response to the honor in one word on Twitter: “Humbled.” Another big accomplishment for Felix, it’s her first season as a mother.

She discussed the emotional toll the NICU takes on the families that have to stay there
