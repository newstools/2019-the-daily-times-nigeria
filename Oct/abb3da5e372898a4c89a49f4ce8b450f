This was when he slotted home from the penalty spot at the second time of asking for Real’s third goal in the 24th minute. Ramos had initially seen his shot saved but was given a second attempt as a VAR review ruled that Leganes goalkeeper Juan Soriano had strayed off the goalline before diving to parry the ball away. Real had made a flying start to the game, taking the lead in the seventh minute through 18-year-old Rodrygo Goes and doubling it 60 seconds later through Toni Kroos.
