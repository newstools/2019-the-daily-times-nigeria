Greek sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas edged out Canadian Felix-Auger Aliassime in a match between two of the most exciting talents on the men’s tour.

Victory moved Tsitsipas closer to qualifying for the ATP Finals in London next month, while German fifth seed Alexander Zverev – another still hoping to qualify and have the chance to defend his title – also needed two tie-breaks to overcome French veteran Jeremy Chardy 7-6 (15-13) 7-6 (7-3).
