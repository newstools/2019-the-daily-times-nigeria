Abuja – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the National Assembly (NASS) to redirect the 2020 budget to areas that would better serve the interest of majority of Nigerians. The party gave the advice in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan on Tuesday in Abuja. President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday presented a N10.33 trillion 2020 budget to the joint session of the National Assembly. Ologbondiyan said that the budget as it is would further impoverish Nigerians and mortgage the future of the nation. ”The core of the budget remains hazy, showing streaks of padding, duplication, replete with false performance indices, deceptive projections and inexplicable expenditure assertions,” he said.These according to him would create openings for diversion of public funds.
