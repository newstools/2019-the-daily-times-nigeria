By Ukpono Ukpong The New Zealand’s newly engaged Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, has disclosed that she and her partner, Clarke Gayford, are yet to make any plans for wedding. Ardern said on Monday she was surprised when her long-time partner proposed to her over the Easter holidays. While addressing her weekly post cabinet press conference on Monday, she also revealed why she is wearing her engagement ring on the middle finger. “I have not been trying to hide our news from anyone. It’s Clarke’s grandmother’s ring and it simply does not fit on the right finger; that’s why it’s sitting on the middle. PM Ardern said the proposal was made when the couple, plus her diplomatic protection security, some locals, and a dog who stole her chocolates, were at a “beautiful little lookout” on Mokotahi hill on the Mahia peninsula in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand. “So, it was very romantic…,” she joked. She implied that her partner did not go down on one knee to pop the question. “The DPS were up there and they had no idea what had happened; that should be a bit of a giveaway to you,’’ said PM Ardern. The forthcoming nuptials are a rarity for world leaders in office and follow Ardern’s pregnancy last year which was seen around the globe as a symbol of progress for female leaders. Ardern is only the second elected leader to give birth while in office, after Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto in 1990 and, if she marries while in office, will be the first major leader to do so in recent years. Her fiance; is a 41-year-old host of a television fishing show who takes care of their 10-month-old daughter Neve Te Aroha, while PM Ardern, 38, runs the country. News of their engagement broke after journalists noticed PM Ardern wearing a ring on her middle finger at a public event on Friday.
