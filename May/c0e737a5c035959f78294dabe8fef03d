Victor Osimhen
will be aiming to score his 18th goal of the season for Sporting Charleroi
later tonight (Wednesday) and his second against Westerlo when they clash at
Het Kuipje stadium. The in-form Super
Eagles striker, Osimhen has scored 17 goals in 33 league appearances providing
four assists since joining Sporting Charleroi who are also in the hunt for a
UEFA Europa League Play-offs spot. The former youth
international scored 12 league goals during the regular season in 25 games,
four so far in six games for his team in the play-offs and one in the Belgian
Cup (Beker van Belgie). The Nigerian
international joined Sporting Charleroi on a season-long loan deal from
Wolfsburg last summer was on target for Sporting Charleroi who edged Westerlo
2-0 in last month’s UEFA Europa League Play-offs reverse fixture. The 20-year-old
who is one of the ten forwards listed in Gernot Rohr’s provisional squad list
for the 2019 Africa Cup Of Nations in Egypt has shown no sign of slowing down
ahead of the tournament. Sporting Charleroi
lead the Europa League play-off Group A with 16 points from eight games. “The football in
Belgium has helped, I also have a wonderful group of players around me and the
coaching crew has been great with me,” he said. “We lead our group
and we pray for another win on Wednesday to seal a berth in the next round of
the Europa League play-off. “I have
comfortably found my happiness again at Charleroi, and I thank everyone in
Belgium and at Wolfsburg for the opportunity and support.” Osimhen was the
top scorer as Nigeria clinched a fifth Under-17 World Cup title in 2015 with 10
goals in Chile, which saw him win the Golden Boot and Silver Ball.
