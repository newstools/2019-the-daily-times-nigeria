By Adewale Momoh, Akure The Ondo state chapter of the Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has commended the federal government on the recently introduced financial guidelines for local governments by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU). State NULGE Chairman, Comrade Bola Taiwo, who stated this during a press conference on Monday in Akure, the Ondo state capital emphasized that the move would ensure transparency and grassroots development. According to Comrade Taiwo, the local government autonomy has been long overdue, adding that “we are happy because this is a dream comes true. We have been yearning and agitating for this because autonomy to local government has been our priority.” He added that the new guidelines will serve as a mechanism that will safeguard, protect and allow for transparency in the local government joint account management. “Joint account is a constitutional matter, but the modification just made is to stop siphoning of our money,” Taiwo stated. He posited that the union would train and educate its members to look into activities of each local government so that there would not be any violation of the new guidelines. “It is said that anybody that violates this rule will be dealt with and if there are violations the union must cry out immediately. I want to say it categorically, that Ondo state governor does not tamper with local government money, rather he gives local councils 100 per cent freedom to deliberate on their money. So, he does not indulge in anything that is against rules and regulations,” he stated.
