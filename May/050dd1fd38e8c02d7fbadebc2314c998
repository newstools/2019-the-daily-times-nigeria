Lawal-Ida spoke at the NiMET-CASP down-scaling workshop for 2019 seasonal rainfall prediction in Sokoto. He said IFAD had been working with NiMET to provide early warning system to farmers. He therefore, urged farmers from Sokoto, Kebbi, Zamfara and Katsina states to be guided by the 2019 seasonal rainfall prediction to avoid losses. In his remarks, the Director General of NiMET, Prof. Sani Mashi, said the rainfall prediction would guide farmers on what to do at the appropriate time. Prof. Mashi, who was represented by the Director, Research, NiMET, Dr. Mansur Matazu said framers would now know the time to expect rainfall, its cessation period and what to plant. “This will enable them to plan well during the farming season,” he said. A farmer who spoke to newsmen, Alhaji Ibrahim Tangaza said they had benefited a lot from the 2018 NiMET prediction and described the workshop as apt and   would give farmers in the entire zone the courage and motivation to go into the farming season without any reservations.
