Bandits riding on five motorcycles have invaded Illo Town in Bagudo Local Government Area of Kebbi state. Reports have it that the bandits who were armed with several machine guns shot sporadically into the air forcing residents and the local vigilantes to scamper for safety. The report also revealed that there was no injury or life lost, but the incident has made many residents of the town flee to neighbouring communities. When contacted, the Bagudo Local Government Chairman, Alhaji Muhammad Kaura confirmed the invasion, saying it occurred at 11:30 pm on Monday. “The bandits were first sighted roaming around the area, buying bread, soft drinks and water in the afternoon, but nobody showed any concern to report them to the appropriate authorities,” he said. Kaura said the bandits later laid siege on the community, adding that “when our vigilante and residents countered their moves, they just brought out highly sophisticated machine guns and started shooting sporadically. “It was then that our people took to their heels and scampered for safety to save their lives. Nobody has been kidnapped, shot or killed in the invasion.” The chairman called on the residents to be vigilant and to report any suspicious lurking character around the area to the security agencies. “The situation has been brought under control as residents have now continued with their normal activities,” the chairman said. When contacted on the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Nafiu Abubakar, said” I will get back to you.”
