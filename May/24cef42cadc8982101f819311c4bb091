Titus Akhigbe, Benin Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki has assured workers that a joint-committee would be set up to accelerate the implementation of the newly approved N30, 000 minimum wage in the state. The governor who disclosed this at the University of Benin Sports Complex in Benin City, during a rally to mark the 2019 May Day celebration reaffirmed his commitment to pay above the N30, 000 minimum wage as soon as the state’s revenue increases. He also assured that plans were underway to harmonise pension based on the new minimum wage, as payment of backlog of pension and gratuity arrears is underway. “You were in Government House in October and I promised that Edo will be one of the first states to implement the new minimum wage if signed into law. Now that the President has assented to the bill passed by the National Assembly, Edo State Government is happy to commence implementation of the new minimum wage.”
