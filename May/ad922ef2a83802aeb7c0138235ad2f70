 By Esther Taiwo, Lagos Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is expected to shed more light on the role of African universities in nation building when he delivers the 23rd convocation lecture of the Lagos state University (LASU) titled: “Africa centres of excellence in African universities: A veritable catalyst for nation building and development” on May 16. During the convocation, LASU will be graduating a total of 14, 369 students who have successfully completed their diploma, first and second degree programmes with 57 students graduating with first class honours. This was disclosed by the Vice Chancellor of LASU, Prof. Lanre Fagbohun, at a press briefing on Thursday as part of activities to kick-start the ceremonies. It would be recalled that the institution graduated 26 first class students last year, a feat that was attributed to the quality assurance regime being institutionalized by the university. Fielding questions from newsmen, the vice chancellor revealed that graduates of the institution were ready for the competitive world and that they had good plans for themselves. “The ready set work programme of the institution has exposed our students to how to be self-reliant and we have also started career development centre where all students are being tutored on different vocations and they are being monitored. “LASU has a centre for entrepreneurial studies. The bottle water that the institution will use for the convocation ceremony is being packaged by the students, who are working there,” he said. Prof. Fagbohun disclosed that the overall best graduating students are Oladotun Ola-Gbadamosi from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Epe campus and Nneka Karen Enumah of the Faculty of Science, the duo attained the same highest cumulative grade point average of 4. 88. Also the duo of Faith Chidinma Uzuegbu and Adenike Anthonia Abati, both of the Department of English in the Faculty of Arts emerged the best graduating students with a CGPA of 4.41 each.
