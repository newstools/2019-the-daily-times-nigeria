By Ahmad Sorondinki, Kano Kano state Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has applauded the federal government for securing the release of Zainab Aliyu, a Nigerian falsely accused of drug peddling in Saudi Arabia. A statement signed by the commissioner for Information, Youth and Culture, Malam Muhammad Garba, said that it was a commendable effort by the government to have successfully established through the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) that the Nigerian was a victim of a drug cartel at the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport Kano. The statement said that the Governor also welcomes confirmation by the Nigerian Mission in the Kingdom that the second Nigerian involved in the case, will be released to the Nigerian Embassy in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. The statement further commended the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice; Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of Aviation, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Diaspora and the Nigerian Mission in Saudi Arabia for the intervention. Governor Ganduje therefore stressed the need for vigilance at the nationâ€™s airport in order to protect Nigerians from falling prey to cartels that specialise in planting drugs in the bags of unsuspecting travelers.
