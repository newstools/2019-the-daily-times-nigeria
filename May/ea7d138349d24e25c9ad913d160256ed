Mathew Dadiya, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the government and people of South Africa over the loss of lives resulting from torrential downpours and mudslides in parts of the country. The president said he is profoundly touched by the unfortunate incident. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu on Sunday, stated that Buhari extends his deep sympathy to families affected by the natural disaster, praying that God will comfort and strengthen them in their hour of need. “I am saddened by the loss of lives and destruction caused by the natural disaster. Such disasters destroy within hours everything the people have laboured for, forcing many to start from the scratch. This is particularly difficult for developing countries battling with poverty. “Our prayers and sympathies are with the people of South Africa as they struggle to overcome the devastating impact of these floods,’’ the President said.
