By Amaka Agbu, Port Harcourt TheRivers state government has announced its preparedness to henceforth, sanction companies that award surveillance jobs to known cultists. Governor Nyesom Wike, made this known during a courtesy visit by the Ambassador of France to Nigeria, Mr. Jerome Pasquier at the Government House, Port Harcourt on Wednesday. Wike said that before such surveillance jobs are awarded, the companies should inform the state government for proper scrutiny of the beneficiaries, declaring that “companies encourage cultists by giving them surveillance jobs. We must know those doing these surveillance jobs. “When you empower them, they have more money to acquire arms. Any company that gives surveillance jobs to cultists will be sanctioned.” He appealed to the French ambassador to prevail on the authorities not to politicize the security of the country and equally, called on the French embassy to take steps to ensure that Air France returns to Port Harcourt, adding that the state government was prepared to support the airline through relevant policies. Responding, the French envoy, Mr. Jerome Pasquier noted that there was a major French presence in Rivers state through the operations of Total and other firms. He said that the embassy would continue to work towards a greater French presence in the state.
