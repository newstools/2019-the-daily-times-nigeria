The United Nations has designated the leader of a militant group behind a deadly bomb attack that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war as a terrorist. According to the UN, Masood Azhar is the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a group that allegedly carried out a suicide bombing in February killing 40 troops in Indian-administered Kashmir. The UN move comes after China dropped its objection to the listing. India hailed it as a diplomatic victory. Masood Azhar will be subject to an assets freeze and travel ban.
