Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki has said that there was no rift between him and his predecessor in office, Adams Oshiomhole, who is also the current National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as being alleged in some quarters. Obaseki made the clarification at the Benin Airport upon his arrival in the state following a one-month vacation. The governor described as fake news, the reported rift with Oshiomhole over his second term ambition. Obaseki said that people of the state should be engaging themselves with how the government could provide good governance to them and not petty issues. He said that Edo people should expect more “wake and see” as he had returned refreshed, feeling good and ready to continue to deliver good governance to the people of the state. Obaseki, who was accompanied by his wife, Betsy, arrived the Benin Airport at exactly 11.30am. NAN reports that combined security operatives from the 4th brigade, DSS, and the police had a hectic time controlling the mammoth crowd that thronged the airport to welcome the governor. Deputy Governor Phillip Shaibu, Secretary to the state government, Osarodion Ogie, Edo State House of Assembly Speaker, Kabiru Adjoto and Chief of staff to the governor, Taiwo Akerele, and some APC leaders were among officials who received the governor.
