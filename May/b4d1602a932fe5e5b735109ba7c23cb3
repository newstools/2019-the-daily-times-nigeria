Tunde Opalana, Abuja As the race for who emerges as presiding offices of both chambers of the National Assembly intensifies, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said its leadership and elected federal legislators have not taken any official position on who to lend their support. The party’s position is predicated on reports in a section of the media suggesting that its members-elect in the House of Representatives have settled for a particular aspirant as the new House speaker. According to its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP is still consulting with its members-elect and no official position has been taken on the issue, particularly, “as the positions of presiding officers are not the exclusive preserve of the ruling party or any other party for that matter, but a constitutional right of every elected lawmaker in their respective chambers.” He said the party has an array of elected lawmakers, in both chambers, who are eminently qualified and equally popular among their colleagues across the political divide, to hold office as presiding officers of both chambers of the National Assembly, in line with Section 50 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). “What is important to Nigerians is the emergence of a purposeful leadership that will ensure accountability and good governance in the polity. “The PDP as a party committed to the wellbeing of our nation, will remain focused in our determination to rescue our nation from incompetent system and therefore, urges Nigerians to discountenance such reports suggesting that our lawmakers have settled for a particular aspirant for any presiding office in the National Assembly,” he said.
