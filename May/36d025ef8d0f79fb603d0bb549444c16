Gbenga Sodeinde, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti state Landlords’ Association has sued the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) for alleged over-billing and illegal disconnection of electricity supply in the state. In an originating summons filed at the Federal High Court, Ado Ekiti, the landlords under the auspices of the Ado Ekiti Electricity Consumers’ Association, said the BEDC contravened the Electricity Reform Act, 2005, which recommends that all electricity consumers must be metered before two years of connection. The suit was filed by the Chairman of the body, Dr. Ibukun Ogundipe and four others. Joined in the suit are the BEDC and the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) as 2nd defendant. The plaintiffs through their lawyer, Isaac Omolade, prayed the court for an order of mandamus compelling the NERC to revoke the BEDC operational licence for flouting extant regulations. They prayed the court to determine among other things whether the BEDC going by provisions of Sections 32, 80, 81, 82 and 96 of the Electricity Reform Act, 2005, were empowered to impose arbitrary charges without deferring to the NERC. Also, the plaintiffs are seeking a perpetual injunction restraining the BEDC from disconnecting or imposing monthly bill of more than N3,100 as contained in their prayers and deposition. They are further seeking an order compelling the BEDC to pay the association N1 million as general damages and another order compelling the distribution company to give pre-paid meters to consumers. The landlords contended that having regards to Sections 63 and 76 of the Act, that the NERC was empowered by the Act to determine the amount payable for electricity consumed and that the BEDC must comply with the law. They also said the court should nullify the arrears of debts owed by landlords in Ekiti as soon as they are metered, saying the charges were arbitrary and were not done in tandem with the law.
