Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja Two government officials Salisu Sabiu, 55, and Ibrahim Mansur Yola, 51, have been arrested by the operatives of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking In Persons (NAPTIP) for sexually defiling a thirteen year old girl. The duos are both staff of the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports, Abuja. The suspects, who lived in the same neighbourhood with the victim in Dutse, a satellite town in the Federal Capital Territory, were arrested following a tip-off by a well-meaning Nigerian who learnt of the dastardly act being committed by the men against the underage girl. Following their confession and admittance of committing the offence, the suspects will be charged to court and prosecuted under the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act, 2015. Reacting to the news of the arrest, the Director-General of NAPTIP, Dame Julie Okah-Donli, condemned the abominable act and lauded the effort of the well-meaning Nigerian who reported the case to NAPTIP. She added that the Agency will ensure that justice is served through diligent prosecution and sending them to jail. The NAPTIP Boss also used the opportunity to draw the attention of the public to the whistle-blowing policy of the Agency, which she encouraged members of the public to make use of in reporting suspected cases of human trafficking and exploitation. She further assured the whistle-blowers of their complete anonymity and protection by the Agency.
