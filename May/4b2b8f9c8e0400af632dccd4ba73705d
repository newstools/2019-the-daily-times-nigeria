Simeon Nwankwo has
signed a three-year contract extension with Italian Serie B side Crotone. Nwankwo, who
joined the Pythagoreans from Portuguese outfit Gil Vicente in the summer of
2016, was set to become a free agent at the end of the season but he has penned
a new deal that runs through till 2022. “I am very happy
to be able to continue my story with this shirt. In Crotone, I grew up both as
a man and as a footballer and I also became a dad. I thank the club for the
trust it has always placed in me,” Nwankwo told Crotone website. Crotone’s
president Gianni Vrenna lauded the 27-year-old striker upon signing the new
deal, hailing his professionalism. “Simy is an
exemplary professional, an excellent guy both on and off the field. He joined
the Rossoblu family three years ago and won over everyone with his generosity
and goals. We are very satisfied with the agreement reached,” he said. Nwankwo has netted
25 times in 72 games for Crotone across all competitions, with 14 of those
coming in 33 Serie B games as his side finished the 2018-19 season in 11th
place, thus, failing to secure an immediate return to the top-flight. The striker is an
outsider for a place in Gernot Rohr’s squad ahead of Nigeria’s 2019 Africa Cup
of Nations campaign. He has not been
considered as an option ever since the Super Eagles crashed out of the 2018
World Cup in Russia. The three-time
African champions are drawn in Group B alongside Burundi, Guinea and
Madagascar.
