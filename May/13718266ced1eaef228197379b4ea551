Joseph Inokotong, Abuja States in the federation would share N649 billion final tranche  of Paris Club Refund.Finance Minister, Mrs.  Zainab Ahmed who said this yesterday in Abuja explained that debtor-states are expected to settle their debts, adding that the Federal Government plans to begin the final phase of the debt refund. The minister told reporters that “the total sum of N649.434 billion was verified by the ministry as the outstanding balance to be refunded to the state governments.” She also revealed that the payments made by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CNB) as at March stood at N691.560 billion. “The increase in CBN payments partly arose from exchange rate differential at the point of payment,” Mrs Ahmed said. The minister, who did not divulge how much would accrue to each of the 36 states, noted that “some states still have outstanding balances, which will be refunded, in due course.” The minister also stated that N4.8 trillion was shared out to the three-tiers of government between September, last year and April from the Federation Account. “The sum of N784.7 billion realised from Value Added Tax (VAT) for the same period was also shared.”
