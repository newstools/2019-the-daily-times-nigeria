Teachers weren’t big earners but my dad, with the help of my mum, provided everything all 4 of us needed – maybe not wanted, but definitely needed. ‘’ I remember when my dad went to Uniben for his first degree. My sisters and I were very young, and communication with him was pretty much impossible because it was before the era of cellphones. We only saw him when he had school breaks.
