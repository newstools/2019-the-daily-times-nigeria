By Mathew Dadiya, Abuja After governing Oyo state for two terms, the outgoing Governor, Abiola Ajimobi has revealed what he could not do and his regret, adding that he regrets the fact that he was unable to do everything he wanted to do. The governor said this on Friday when he spoke to State House correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said that he wished the people of Oyo state could be more understanding, could be more patient, but they feel that “anytime you try to make a change, people resist change even if it’s good for them.” The governor also regretted that he wished he had been in politics 20 years ago. However, the governor who expressed gratitude to God for making him the only governor to have governed the state for two consecutive terms said he has built a legacy that would stand the test of time. Ajimobi also thanked President Buhari for the support he has given all the states, particularly during the period of scarcity of funds to execute projects, pay salaries and meet other socio-economic development demands. “He (Buhari) was on hand to help all of us. He supported us by releasing funds to all of us and as at today, that I am talking most of the states, including Oyo state do not owe salaries. “He also assisted us with social infrastructure that is extending the welfare nets to the states, that is why I am here to thank Mr. President because in another two days I am going for Umrah and by the time I come back I won’t be in office as governor. “I am going to Umrah to thank God. When I came in, I pleaded with God to give me the opportunity to serve peacefully and that He did. I also want to thank the people of Oyo state for allowing me to be the first governor to do two terms of eight years, it has never happened in Oyo state,” he added.
