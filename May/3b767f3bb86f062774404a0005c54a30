Mathew Dadiya, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has returned to Abuja, after a 10-day private visit to the United Kingdom. The President’s plane landed at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja at exactly 6:24pm on Sunday. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, observed that “some reckless online media, irresponsible political opposition, and other bilious groups and individuals, had gone on overdrive since the President left the country on April 25, insinuating that he was going for hospitalisation, and would not return after 10 days as stated. “In their vain imaginations, they even stated that fictive doctors have advised President Buhari to stay longer for more intensive care. Now that the President has returned, can these apostles of evil imaginings swallow their words? “Can they retract their tendentious stories as well as press statements, and apologise to millions of Nigerians both at home and in the Diaspora that they have fed with hogwash? “Few days after the celebration of World Press Freedom Day, we daresay that this valuable freedom does not tantamount to liberty to mislead and hoodwink the populace through concocted and jejune publications.” The Presidential spokesman said that the Buhari administration would always respect and uphold press freedom, but the onus lies on those prone to passing off fiction as facts, to remember that freedom demands concomitant responsibility. He added that those who further share and disseminate falsehood were also encouraged to embrace responsible conduct.
