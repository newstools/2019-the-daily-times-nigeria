Titus Akhigbe, Benin The National Assembly and state House of Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Benin on Friday fixed May 14 to rule on whether the İndependent National Electoral Commission (İNEC) was properly served in a petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against the All Progressives Congress (APC). In the petition filed by the PDP’s Rep. Omosede İgbinedion, the House of Representatives member from Edo state is challenging the victory of the of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Dennis İdahosa in the election for the Ovia Federal Constituency. Chairman of the tribunal, Justice O. Ogundana announced the date after listening to arguments on the motion filed by the first respondent (İNEC) and Rep. İgbinedion, the petitioner. During the pre-trial hearing of the petition by the tribunal, İNEC had filed a motion stating that it was not properly served the court processes. Counsel to INEC, Christian Omatsome informed the tribunal that the electoral umpire ought to have been served with the processes at INEC national headquarters in Abuja, instead of the commission being served in Benin, the Edo state capital as was done by the PDP. While describing the service complained about as “bad service,” Omatsome said it was an issue of law and not that of proceedings and therefore, urged the tribunal to set aside the petition. Responding, counsel to Rep. Igbinedion, Ferdinand Orbih told the tribunal that the motion by INEC was only a delay tactics employed by commission to prolong the hearing of the originating petition filed by his client. After hearing counsels to both parties, the Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Ogundana thereafter, fixed May 14 for judgement on the motion.
