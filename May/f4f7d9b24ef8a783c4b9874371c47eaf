Agency report The recent low profile of Kenyan leader, Uhuru Kenyatta especially after his sneaky return from China is said to be giving the citizens of the country serious concern. Online community #FindPresidentUhuru, had raised the concern and sought to know the whereabouts of the president who is uncharacteristically silent and out of public sight for nearly two weeks. The worry was further aggravated by the fact that personal social media pages of the president were wiped off the internet under unclear circumstance recently, thereby leaving official State House handles which are currently littered with photos of the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta. “Silence annoys even the devil. Leading Kenyans is like herding needy cats. Uhuru should give them the contempt card,” a member of the online community was quoted to have said.
