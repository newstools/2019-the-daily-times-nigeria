Nosa Akenzua, Asaba The Forum of Delta state Non- Government Organizations says Governor Ifeanyi Okowa was endorsed for another term in office following his enthroning of good governance in the state. A press statement signed and circulated in Asaba by Okezi Odugula, coordinator, Chief Greg Osamenjor, secretary, and Tombra Kasikoro, publicity secretary respectively, stated that the endorsement of Gov. Okowa by the forum in 2015 and in 2018 for the second term was not an attempt at praise singing, but showcasing his credible activities in the state. The statement reads: “We believe firmly in partnership for sustainable development and appreciating persons contributing to the process and criticising constructively when we identify gaps as we are more than ready to continue to monitor government programmes and policies without fear or favour.” The forum however, commended all stakeholders in the state for their cooperation and appealed to Deltans to give more support to the governor to succeed in the next four years, adding that “we urge the governor to give more space to women and youth, we also want him to drop the idea of re-cycling of old political appointees; Delta needs fresh appointees.” Also, it called on the governor to expedite action by assenting to the bill on freedom of information to foster accountability and good governance in the next four years of his administration.
