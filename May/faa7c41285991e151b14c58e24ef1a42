Former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon is reported to have slumped mid way at the grave side oration for late Maj Gen David Akpodiete Ejoor, in Ovwor-Olomu Community, Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta state. Following the incident, military personnel at the burial made efforts to bar visual coverage of the incident. The former head of state was promptly rushed by some top echelons of the military who were at the event into the special tenth for emergency resuscitation, just as Governor Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa and Chief James Onanefe Ibori, former Governor of the Delta state dashed into the tenth to access his health status. Immediately, military as well as the Delta state ambulances were moved closer to the tent in the event the former head of stateâ€™s health deteriorates further. After a moment of suspense, Chief Ibori and Governor  Okowa came out of the special tent, giving an indication that the former army general has recovered.
