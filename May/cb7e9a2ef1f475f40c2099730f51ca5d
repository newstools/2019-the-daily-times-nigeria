An economist, Prof. Segun Ajibola has attributed the underhand dealings in the recruitment process in most Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to high unemployment rate in the country.Prof. Ajibola, who made the observation in Abuja, stated that secretive recruitment was due to the limited employment opportunities in the country, insisting that lack of sufficient employment opportunities encourages underhand dealings in the recruitment process, especially in the public sector.“Stories abound of how the high and mighty ones corner the available opportunities, especially in choice MDAs and at times state and local government levels.“If indeed, the allegations are true, then it is resulting from the yearning gap between the available skills set and the opportunities to engage them. If indeed, unqualified hands are being engaged at the expense of merit, it will be most unfortunate,’’ the academic said.However, Ajibola, said unqualified hands would not be productive and could seek after mundane things to survive in the workplace while well trained, highly qualified individuals waste away.“In all, full employment is a key macroeconomic objective of any government. When unemployment problem is left unaddressed for long, it breeds such social malaise as cultism, armed robbery, militia, social strife, cybercrimes and prostitution, among others,’’ he added.According to him, unemployment wastes human capital and renders intellectual capital redundant.The former president of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, said inflation and unemployment were referred to as the twin evils in economic discourse, stressing that Nigeria has been struggling with the problem of unemployment for a while and this was further worsened by the recent economic recession.“Unemployment creates idle capacity in the labour market, weakens the productive base and reduces the level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Economic dependency ratio is heightened while overall standard of living of the citizenry worsens off,’’ the expert said.Meanwhile, Sen. Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment had described the incessant increase of the unemployment rate in the country as disturbing.According to him, the high unemployment rate of 23.1 per cent and under-employment of 16.6 per cent by the National Bureau Statistics (NBS) 2019 report is alarming, warning that if the situation is not addressed, it could reach 33.5 per cent by 2020.
