Michael Ajayi Following fears of an increase in pump price, Operations Controller of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) Warri Zonal Office, Mr Antai Asuquo, has said the Federal Government has no plans to increase the pump price of petroleum. Asuquo disclosed this on Tuesday on a sideline during the celebration of the “World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development” held simultaneously in all the DPR offices in the country. The annual event with the theme, “Exploring Nigeria’s Diversity and Rich Cultural Heritage” was organised by DPR. The controller urged Nigerians to stop the panic behaviour that could lead to a crisis in the supply chain adding that the product is available and the pump price remains N145 per litre. “There is the availability of petroleum product, the price of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) remain the same and there is no immediate plan to change it. “We should not hurt the product for a particular time because keeping the product at home is dangerous. “Our lives and properties are important so we should value and manage our resources in a way that we do not cause harm to ourselves,” he advised. Asuquo also urged people key into the federal government policy on the use of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) noting that there was abundant cooking gas in the country. “Federal Government is trying to enforce the availability of cooking gas all over the federation and people are encouraged to use it.
