A 47-year-old Chinese woman, Zhen Zhen was on Friday set free by an Ikeja High Court four years after setting ablaze a section of a hotel located in Ikeja, Lagos. Zhen was set free following a plea bargain agreement she entered into with the prosecution team of the Lagos state government. Delivering judgment, Justice Hakeem Oshodi held that Zhen had served more than the two-year sentence recommended in the plea bargain agreement, stating that “the defendant has shown remorse and has been in prison custody for more than two years. “The court is satisfied that the defendant understands the charge she pleaded guilty to and therefore, accepts her plea of guilt. The defendant, Zhen Zhen having spent two years in prison custody, the court hereby orders that she be released forthwith from prison custody today.” Following the judgment, a Chinese interpreter, interpreted the judgment to Zhen in mandarin and upon hearing that she was now a free woman, smiled and clapped in relief and joy. Earlier during proceedings, Ms. Yemisi Olatunde, the state prosecutor informed the court that the Chinese national had entered a plea bargain agreement dated April 24 with the state government. She noted that under the terms of the plea bargain agreement, Zhen will plead guilty to a lesser charge of willful damage to property contrary to Section 350 of the Criminal Law of Lagos state, adding that Zhen has agreed to serve a two-year prison sentence which will be inclusive of the date of her arrest and detention. Zhen was accused on willfully setting ablaze Ernest Place located at No. 28, Bamishile Street, Allen Avenue, Lagos on July 5, 2015. According to the prosecution, the blaze destroyed part of the building.
