Tom Okpe, Abuja Ghana international, Prince Tagoe has stated that the Nigeria National team and Cameroon are threat to the Black Stars’ hopes of winning the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations but he trusts Kwesi Appiah’s outfit to prevail. He also said the June 21 to July 19 championship in Egypt, Ghana will be seeking to end their long wait for a fifth continental title, having last ruled Africa in 1982 and losing finals in 1992, 2010 and 2015. For the first round, the Black Stars have been drawn against Cameroon, Benin and Guinea-Bissau in Group F. “I believe we can win it”, Tagoe 32 and a member of Ghana’s squad at the 2006 AFCON and the 2010 FIFA World Cup said. “Ghanaians need the trophy badly and I know the players themselves also need the trophy too. For the players, they will make history if they are able to win it so I know it means a lot to them. It is not going to be easy because they are equally good teams who are all coming for the trophy. The likes of Nigeria, Senegal, Algeria, and Cameroon are all there. But I strongly believe Ghana can make it. “They just don’t have to allow anything to distract them. They need to concentrate on every game and I believe they will make it”. Ghana will begin their quest against Benin on June 25 and face defending champions Cameroon four days later. The Black Stars will then wrap up their group against Guinea-Bissau on July 2.
