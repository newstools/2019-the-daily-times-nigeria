Samuel Luka, Bauchi Governor Mohammed Abubakar of Bauchi state has been urged to decline assent to the bill seeking the repeal of the Public Property and Fund Recovery Tribunal Law of 2017 passed by the state House of Assembly few days ago. The Centre for Information Technology and Development’ (CITAD) which kicked against the bill, explained that it is detrimental to the interests of the state and charged all stakeholders in the state to openly oppose the signing of the repeal bill into law‎. Program Officer of CITAD in Bauchi, Mohammed Hassan alleged that the latest bill was a ploy by public officers who might have looted funds in the outgoing government to cover up and shield themselves from investigation to escape prosecution. Hassan, who pointed out that there was no reason whatsoever to repeal the earlier law that sought to checkmate corruption, suggested that reviewing a sensitive issue that affects the lives and economy of the people in the state should have been subjected to public hearing. He decried that the state lawmakers introduced the bill and allegedly subjected it to first, second, third readings and passed it into law the same day with only 13 out of 31 members of the state House of Assembly in attendance which he alleged was suspicious. “The Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD) received with shock the decision of the Bauchi state House of Assembly to repeal a law that provides for the investigation of public officers who might have misappropriated state funds entrusted in their hands. “By this new bill passed by the state House of Assembly if allowed to be assented in the state, it will cancel the initial law that provides ground for the investigation and prosecution of anybody that is found wanting in misappropriating the state funds,” Hassan said. He added that the centre suspects that the rationale for the new bill is a ploy by public office holders in the outgoing government to cover up and protect themselves from investigation with the hope of getting away unpunished.
