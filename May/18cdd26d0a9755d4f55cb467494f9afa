…Accused opposition of romancing with coupe plotters …Says PDP sabotaging Buhari’s administration Mathew Dadiya, Abuja The Federal Government has raised the alarm that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) poses a great danger to the survival of the Nigerian democracy. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed said this on Wednesday while addressing State House correspondents at the Presidential Villa Abuja. He alleged that the increasingly unpatriotic and desperate opposition politics being played by the PDP and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, warning that such dead-end opposition could be toxic for the nation’s democracy, if left unchecked. The information minister said that never in the history of politics in Nigeria has an opposition party and its presidential candidate exhibited the kind of desperate tactics being deployed by the duo of the PDP and its flag-bearer, especially since President Muhammadu Buhari overwhelmingly defeated Atiku to win the 2019 presidential election.
