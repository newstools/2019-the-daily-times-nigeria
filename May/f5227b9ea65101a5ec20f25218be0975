Ahmad Sorondinki, Kano Kano State House of Assembly has adopted the bill seeking for the upgrading of some traditional rulers to the status of 1st class emirs, following a recent petition written by some legal practitioners in the state. The bill on Tuesday scaled its first reading at the House, which also adopted the report of its standing committee on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs as well as that of Judiciary. This followed an earlier petition on Monday seeking for the creation of four additional emirates in the state made up of Bichi, Gaya, Rano and Karaye. It was however the contention of the petitioner that the demand it had presented was in consonance with the Kano Emirate Council amendment law which the House majority leader, Alhaji Baffa Babba Danagundi, concurred with the submission of the petitioners on the existence of the Emirate Council amendment law. Reading the joint committee report at the floor of the house, the majority leader, Alhaji Baffa Danagundi, said the report also recommended a review of the law after widespread consultations with stakeholders. According to him, the response received clearly indicates that the need to upgrade the traditional rulers has become necessary due to the enormous size of the state. Following series of debates and suggestions, the members unanimously adopted the report. Meanwhile, hundreds of Kano residents stormed the premises of the Assembly with placards carrying different inscriptions in support of the move for additional Emirates in state.
