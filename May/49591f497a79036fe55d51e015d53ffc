Isaac Job, Uyo Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom state is ready to resuscitate moribund companies owned by the state government before completion of his second term in 2023 in line with his administration’s industrialization policy. Senior Special Assistant to the governor on Marketing and Brand Management, Sam Edoho disclosed this to newsmen at a press conference to mark Democracy Day tagged: “Akwa Ibom: Celebrating a secured future.” Edoho said some of the ailing industries include Quality Ceramics, former Peacock Paints now known as Ibom Paints, Qua Steel Industries as well as others that were moribund over the years. He recalled that Gov. Udom was voted into power in 2015 on a five -point agenda that captured job creation, poverty alleviation, wealth creatio, infrastructural consolidation and political inclusion. The governor’s aide charged Akwa Ibom people to share in the euphoria and joy of being an Akwa Ibom person at a time when the state has moved from zero industry to 16 brand new industries, asserting that the governor has set the state on an industrial pedestal to secure the future of the people. “The future celebrated by Akwa Ibom people has the skies of Africa and the world lit with orange colour of Akwa Ibom state which is Ibom Air,” he stated, Adding that the development exploits of the governor cut across health, education, agriculture and other sectors of the economy. He faulted what he described as weird statistics from federal government agencies concerning the number of out–of-school children and the unemployment rate in the state. Edoho further explained that the governor has increased employment in the state and wondered why such statistics were attributed to Akwa Ibom even with its thriving industries and the recruitment of over 8, 000 teachers in public schools.
