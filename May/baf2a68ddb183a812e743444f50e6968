The transition committee set up by Adamawa Governor-elect, Alhaji Ahmadu Fintiri has raised an alarm over what it described as the illegal and unauthorized auctioning of government’s properties. Secretary to the committee, John Yahya stated this in a statement on Friday in Yola. Yahya alleged that some officials of the outgoing administration of Gov. Muhammadu Bindow were auctioning government’s properties to themselves. “A particular case in point is Adamawa Agricultural Development and Investment Limited (AADIL) where government officials have concluded arrangements to auction the assets to themselves any moment, in spite of the fact that the contractor has not fully supplied all the items which is against the procurement law. “We also want to draw the attention of the current government that the transition committee is in possession of the correct inventory of all items of the agency as against what has been submitted to it,” he said. The secretary also accused the outgoing administration of awarding bogus contracts and conducting illegal recruitments into the civil service, declaring that the committee would recommend to the incoming administration the need for forensic investigation of the complete inventory of movable and unmovable public assets with a view to holding those involved in looting government’s properties responsible. When contacted, the state’s Head of Service, Amos Edgar said he was not aware of any auctioning of government’s properties, adding that those making the allegation should provide prove for necessary action. On the accusation of illegal recruitment, he said he was not aware of any illegal appointments, adding that all he knew was that normal recruitments took place.
