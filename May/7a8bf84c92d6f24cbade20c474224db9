Former NBA star, Lamar Odom, who recently released a book titled, “Darkness to Light”, has spoken on his relationship with Taraji P. Henson. Lamar while speaking on his relationship with the Hollywood actress before he met Khloe Kardashian, described it as the “happiest times in [his] life.” “We ended up exchanging numbers. She was just such a wise woman that she could see through whatever smooth act I was trying to put on. She refused to be just another conquest, and truthfully, I didn’t want her to be. We started secretly dating and quickly fell in love.” Their relationship lasted few months before it ended due to infidelity. “[Taraji] introduced me to her fourteen-year-old son, Marcel, and was at my house nearly every day. Sometimes she’d bring some of her Hollywood friends, like actress Sanaa Lathan. I don’t think I ever connected with another black woman as deeply as I did Taraji. Things were amazing, but of course, God gave me a layup and I blew it.”
