Meanwhile, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) yesterday disclosed that MTN has paid N275 billion SIM infraction fine as balance of N55 billion was due this month. The Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Umar Danbatta, made this known while speaking on the state of MTN fine payment at the valedictory service organised for the Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu, in Abuja. He said following a negotiated reduction of the N1.04 trillion fine on MTN Nigeria to N330 billion and in line with the staggered payment arrangement, MTN has, so far, paid N275 billion to the federal government. Mr Danbatta said part of the fallout of the negotiated terms of payment of the fine is the listing of MTN on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), and this is being done. What this means, according to the staggered arrangement, is that May 31, 2019 would be the deadline for the telecoms company to pay the sixth and final tranche of the balance of N55 billion. “After six months of negotiation and re-negotiation over the fine which led to the reduction to N330 billion, it was agreed that MTN would pay a balance of N280 billion in six tranches. “This was in addition to the “goodwill” payment of N50 billion earlier made by MTN to the government. “Specifically, MTN began the payment structure with the payment of N30 billion into NCC’s Treasury Single Account (TSA) with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) 30 days from the date of the agreement dated June 10 2016. “Subsequently, MTN paid N30 billion on March 31, 2017; N55 billion on March 31, 2018; N55 billion on December 31, 2018 and on March 31, it paid N55 billion. “The balance and final tranche of the payment will be paid by May 31, 2019, in line with the staggered payments structure agreed by MTN and Nigerian government.
