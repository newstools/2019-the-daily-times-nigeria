By Patrick Okohue The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has  described as false and misleading the allegation of reckless spending against the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Mr. Kingsley Chinda, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a statement signed by its Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary, Cassidy Madueke, BMO said that the PDP is deliberately misleading Nigerians by linking the Buhari administration, which was elected in 2015, to a report from the Auditor-General of the Federation (AGF) covering 2010 to 2014 when the PDP was in power. “The PDP is so desperate in trying to cover its heinous and infamous era of abusing and recklessly misdirecting national resources for the benefit of a tiny clique by blaming the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration falsely and pretending that Muhammadu Buhari was in power between 2010 and 2014. “Attributing the 2010 and 2014 report of PDP-led Federal Government’s reckless spending to the Buhari administration is akin to insulting the intelligence and dignity of Nigerians, who have been clearly taken for granted by the PDP and its agents like Mr. Kingsley Chinda.” The BMO said that it was unfortunate that whenever the misdeeds of the PDP were exposed to the public, the ‘dying political party’ would shift the blame to the current administration, simply because President Muhammadu Buhari is not given to joining issues with a political party that has lost all decorum and sense of self-worth after its crushing defeat by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2015 and 2019 general elections. “The obvious manipulation of its failure and shifting blames by the PDP to deflect attention and public scrutiny from its failure to ensure the well-being of Nigerians is both shameful and politically wrong,” the BMO emphasised. The group recalled that the Buhari administration had the political will to implement the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system, traceable e-payments for all its financial transactions, and the Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit to enhance transparency in public expenditure, eliminate phony payments and end the era of ghost workers on federal staff payroll.
