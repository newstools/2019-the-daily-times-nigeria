By Nosa Akenzua, Asaba The Delta state government on Monday reassured citizens of the state that it will not compromise standard in the ongoing recruitment of 1, 000 teachers in science related subjects and the English Language into public secondary schools across the state. Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education, Chiedu Ebie, who spoke to our correspondent said that the recruitment of teachers would be purely based on merit, adding that the state government was irrevocably committed to engaging qualified teachers who can impact sound knowledge to their students in line with global best practices in the teaching profession. According to him, the applicants do not need to know any prominent person before they can be employed provided they do excellently well in the online test and oral interview that would be conducted. “We are not going to compromise standard in any way in the recruitment exercise, as our intention is to have quality teachers for enhanced academic productivity in our schools and it’s for this reason that the state government established the Teachers’ Professional Development Centre,” Ebie said. The commissioner disclosed that over 47, 000 applications were received by the state government, adding that 1, 000 successful applicants would be employed by the state government. He enjoined applicants who wrote the examination to believe in themselves, saying that “if they do well in the selection process, they would be recruited and taken to the rural areas of the state.”
