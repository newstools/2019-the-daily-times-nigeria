The Archbishop of Enugu Ecclesiastical Province, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Rev Emmanuel Chukwuma, has tasked Nigerians to prepare for a revolution. Attributing the high rate of poverty to bad governance, Bishop Chukwuma said that the N30, 000 new minimum wage would not reduce poverty in Nigeria, adding that inflation would render the new pay worthless. The cleric said that “there is hunger and people are deprived of the basic necessities of life in Nigeria and the N30, 000 new minimum wage which amounts to N1, 000 per day would not solve any problem. “How would people pay for house rent, school fees, medical fees and other utilities which must be taken care of, let alone feeding themselves and their families. It is high time the expired and old politicians who have held Nigeria down leave the stage so that we can have a new Nigeria of our dream where things work,” he said. The Anglican archbishop urged the Nigeria Labour Congress to champion the revolution which, according to him is imminent, just as he called for the restructuring of the country. Chukwuma added that “all political appointments must reflect federal character. Since the president and his deputy come from the North-West and South-West respectively, the position of the Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives should go to other zones.”
