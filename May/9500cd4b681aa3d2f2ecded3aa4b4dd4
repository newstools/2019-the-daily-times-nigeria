Leader of the military team, Maj. Yakubu Kachaallah, who confirmed that the military acted on intelligence gathering within Koko to ensure that the illegality was not accomplished, said “we got wind of the illegality that the impending crude heist taking place at the Jones creek and acting on the intelligence, we got hold of the 50 boats and immediately set them on fire, while the owners fled for fear of arrest. “Men and officers of the battalion are working relentless to ensure that perpetrators of illegal refineries are brought to book.” Maj. Kachaallah disclosed that officers of the military intelligence have been on patrol in the creeks, especially in Egbema Kingdom, including Oporozua and other part of Warri South West Local Government Area, adding that neighbouring communities over the years have suffered untold hardship as a result of the havoc wreaked by these illegal oil bunkers and refinery operators.
