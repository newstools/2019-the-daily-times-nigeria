Kano state government has described as false and misleading a media report that said a court in the state nullified the recent appointment of Emirs by Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje. In a press statement issued Wednesday which was signed by the Chief Press Secretary to Ganduje, Abba Anwar, the government explained that the court ruled that all parties should return to status quo, which to the government means that all appointed Emirs should maintain their position. “A misleading story that mischievously emanated from one media organization, which owner is also an interested party concerning the newly appointed Emirs of Bichi, Karaye, Rano and Gaya, that a court sitting in Ungogo nullifies their appointment, is but an aggressive false news item. “The Kano State High Court, sitting in Ungogo only ordered for the return to status-quo, which in our side, means all appointed Emirs maintain their positions,” the statement said. According to the Chief Press Secretary, “From the time Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje assented to the Law establishing the Emirs up to the time he served them with Letters of Notification of Appointment, he was not served with any Court Order restraining him from doing that. “The final thing he did to the newly Emirs was presentation of Staff of Office which took place on Sunday 12th May, 2019. After Justice Nasiru Saminu ordered for the return of the status-quo, pending further hearing, the hearing is fixed for 21st June, 2019,” he said. Cautioning against false information, Abba Anwar said referred the public and other stakeholders in the state to confirm from the records of the court that issued the order so as to be properly guided on the matter. “Practitioners and members of the public should cross-check this with the Kano State High Court, sitting in Ungogo, under Justice Nasiru Saminu which gave out this position for further clarification and informed angle of the story from,” he stated.
