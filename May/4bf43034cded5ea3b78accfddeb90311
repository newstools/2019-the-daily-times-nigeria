Our reporter Civil servants in Plateau state were on Wednesday left in limbo as the state Governor, Simon Lalong who was recently re-elected for a four-year term told them that his administration will only pay the N30,000 when the internally generated revenue of the state improves. The governor therefore charged the workers to join him and his administration and work hard in order to boost the revenue of the state. “We would assiduously work hard with you workers to improve the IGR of the State so as to meet up with the payment of the new minimum wage”, Lalong said. “Comrades it behooves on you to as a matter of prudence, expose all leakages and bring to bear ghost workers. By doing this, we would have more resources at our disposal to take care of the many needs of our workers. “We have at the moment paid some funds for the acquisition of Land for Civil Service Housing Scheme, and all other processes for the development have reached advanced level and at the appropriate time you will be notified of the needful. “Like I have always said, workers are amongst the first line priority of our administration and this government will always initiate policies and programmes that will be beneficial to workers,” the governor said.
