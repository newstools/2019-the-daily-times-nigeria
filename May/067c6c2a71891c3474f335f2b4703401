By Mathew Dadiya, Abuja Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas has said it is only God that can police such an expanse of sea border that Nigeria has, expressing concerns over arms inflow into the nation. The naval chief said that President Muhammadu Buhari has directed the service chiefs to do all that they can to ensure that they block the gaps and security areas that need to be addressed. Ibas, who spoke on Tuesday to State House correspondents on behalf of the service chiefs after a three –hours closed doors meeting with President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, said members of the public have voluntarily offered information in areas where there are security challenges. On what can be done to protect the nation’s borders, he said that “the solution of course, is to identify other means and strategies of addressing the porous border nature. “The military’s responsibility is to defend the country, but there are other agencies of government that are responsible for manning the various border openings.” He revealed that air and other surveillance activities are being considered as an option. “On the whole, Mr. President was happy with the security situation, the efforts that the armed forces and the security agencies are carrying out to tackle the security challenges. “I’m sure you will recall that we met just about two weeks ago, but the President has to call for this meeting given that tomorrow he will be sworn in. Of course, basically the meeting was to further re-appraise the actions taken after the last meeting. “The spate of insecurity particularly, armed banditry, kidnapping and robbery has been specifically on the increase in some parts of the country,” Ibas added. The naval chief said that there is improved synergy amongst the various agencies that are providing information and intelligence.
