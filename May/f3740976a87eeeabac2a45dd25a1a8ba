Andrew Orolua, Abuja The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja has struck out the application filed by Hope Democratic Party (HDP) seeking to stop inauguration of President Muhammadu Buhari scheduled for May 29. The tribunal said the application filed by the HDP was unmeritorious. Delivering the ruling , Justice Joseph Ikyechi said that the application lacked merit as the applicant did not justify or proffer reasons while an inauguration fixed by statute should be stopped. Recalled that HDP in the motion on notice filed at the tribunal said the request is predicated on the need to preserve the subject matter of its petition and prevent Buhari from foisting a fait accompli and state of hopelessness on the court and render the petition before the tribunal nugatory. The HDP and its presidential candidate in the February 23 presidential election, Chief Albert Owuru, submitted that once there is a question on the validity of election of any person, the person is not competent to take oath of office or assume the seat of power. The party, therefore, prayed the tribunal for an order stopping the president from presenting himself for inauguration on May 29 or any other date until all petitions challenging his election have been fully settled. The party also prayed for another order stopping the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Mohammad, from inaugurating or administering oath of office and oath of allegiance on Buhari until all court actions against him are determined.
