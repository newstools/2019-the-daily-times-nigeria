President-General, the League of Imam and Alfas in Ogun state, Alhaji Liadi Orunsolu, has urged Muslims to seize the opportunity of the Ramadan to demonstrate more love for humanity through acts of charity, kindness and generosity. Orunsolu said this in a statement made available to newsmen in Abeokuta on Monday. He said that it was important to use the opportunity to remember the less privileged and those going through challenges. The president-general also enjoined Muslims to devote themselves fully to the worship of Allah throughout the holy month and use the period to pray for the progress, peace and prosperity of Ogun and the nation. “On behalf of the League of Imams and Alfas in Ogun state, I hereby congratulate all Muslims all over the world, especially those in Ogun state and Nigeria on the commencement of the Ramadan fasting. “Fasting is not just about avoiding food and drinks. Rather, it is an opportunity to strive for inner purification and self-accountability. Ramadan is meant to inculcate righteousness and self -discipline. “As Muslims, the holy month of Ramadhan is an opportunity to engage in sober reflections and absolute return to Allah. I urge all Muslims to devote our souls and bodies in total submission to Allah now and henceforth,” he said. Also, he urged all political office holders to be God- fearing and be dedicated to finding solutions to the numerous challenges facing the nation and enjoined Muslims in the state to pray for the incoming administration of Dapo Abiodun so that it would have a successful, progressive and prosperous tenure.
