The Lagos state Sector Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says over 60, 000 driver’s licenses are yet to be collected by applicants. The Sector Commander of FRSC, Hyginus Omeje, made the disclosure in an interview in Lagos on Wednesday. According to Omeje, this implies that over 60, 000 drivers are driving without a driver’s licence in the state. “The driver’s licence is the only document that qualifies you to be on the road, every other valid document is for your vehicles. Many drivers claim that the reason for not having the driver’s licence is that they were yet to get text messages to come and collect. “Don’t wait until you receive text messages; l use this opportunity to appeal that applicants for driver’s licence should go to where they did their capturing and collect. We have over 60, 000 driver’s licenses waiting to be collected all over Lagos state,” the commander said. Omeje noted that 60 days was the duration given at the point of capture for the document to be ready, but added that within the period, the licence could be printed. He added that “in most cases, we are now meeting up with the 30 days after capturing. The problem now is collection; people feel free to drive with temporary licenses while they continue to give excuse that they have not received text messages for the original licence. “Let applicants feel free to go and collect their driver’s licence at the various centres at no cost. Let them only go with their temporary one and they will be given a valid one. Good thing now, we have driver’s licence valid for three and five years.” Omeje cautioned driver’s licence applicants to desist from patronizing touts, but to go to designated centres to avoid getting fake licences.
