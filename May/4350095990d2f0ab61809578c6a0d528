By Kehinde Akinpelu, Ilorin The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has approved N1, 528, 559.10 as 2019 hajj fare for intending pilgrims to Saudi Arabia from Kwara state. Alhaji Mohammed Tunde-Jimoh, the Executive Secretary, Kwara Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, disclosed this in a statement in Ilorin. Tunde-Jimoh explained that the fare for individual prospective pilgrims was determined by both NAHCON and officials of the 36 states’ Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Boards. Tunde-Jimoh said the 2019 hajj fare for Kwara pilgrims would take care of their air fares, accommodation, transportation and other logistics in Mecca and Medina The executive secretary said all the prospective pilgrims travelling with the board would receive flat rate of 800 dollars each as basic travelling allowance (BTA). He directed the state’s prospective pilgrims who had made deposit of N1.3 million to the board to complete their payment immediately. He added that the arrangement would enable the board to meet the June 15 closing date fixed by NAHCON for completion of payment of 2019 hajj fare The executive secretary urged them to pay the balance of their hajj fares at the Polaris Bank and Zenith Bank and collect the receipts at the board after payment. He said Muslims who are willing to perform 2019 pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia with the board could still make the payment on or before the June 15.
