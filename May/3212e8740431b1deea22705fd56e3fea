By John Ndu Following the ongoing clampdown on street begging and other public nuisance, the Anambra State government has taken the campaign against these social vices to parks and markets in the state, through a dialogic engagements between the Commissioner For Women and Children Affairs, Lady Ndidi Mezue, and her transport counterpart, Comrade Uchenna Okafor (Wiper) with parks and business owners, in major cities in the state. The Commissioners used the opportunity to clampdown street begging and cleared all mentally challenged persons from the streets of Anambra State. The exercise took place at motor parks and markets vis-a-vis Onitsha Main market and Upper Iweka Onitsha. During the exercise, the park owners were solicited to assist the state government in its efforts to rid the streets of Anambra of those seeking alms with under age children and other illegal activities that are mostly associated with motor parks and markets across the state. Responding, some park owners and managers promised to be of help as much as they can to rid the state of these illegality associated with begging and loitering in parks and markets in the state.
