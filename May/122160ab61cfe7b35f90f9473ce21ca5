Founder and Executive Director, Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development (Centre-LSD), Dr. Otive Igbuzor has urged Niger Delta youth to imbibe the culture of leadership through mentorship. Igbuzor made the call during the second annual leadership lecture and graduation ceremony of the Centre-LSD, at Effurun-Warri study centre. Igbuzor, a civil society activist, said that leaders in the oil-rich region have failed the youth, noting that it is time for the youth to develop themselves positively and become relevant in society. “The elders have failed the youth, so the youth should try and develop themselves. When you have a society that is dominated by cabals, the youth need to learn and improve their knowledge to change the values in the society positively. After learning, they also need to act economically, socially and politically to change the scope,” he said. Igbuzor attributed the challenges in the country to leadership problem, noting that most leaders do not have leadership training, adding that “there are nowhere leaders are trained that is why we develop the curriculum for leadership in our centre established in 2009 in Abuja. Also speaking, the Executive Director, Value Rebirth and Empowerment Initiative (VREI), Pastor Edewor Egedegbe said doing the right thing is a big problem in the country. “We have come up with the concept of equipping interested individuals to see how they can transform obstacles to success. We believe that trouble is the breakfast of a hero, when a hero sees trouble, there is opportunity for him to bring the hidden potential in him. “So we are aligning with such forces who want to subscribe to how we can change the narrative in our leadership trait as a nation, particularly the Niger Delta. It is based on this that we are partnering the Centre LSD to develop future leaders and we are achieving result,” he said.
