Samuel Luka, Bauchi The Bauchi state government have been called upon to put measures on ground in order to control any impending flood and cholera outbreak before the commencement of rainy season this year. Training Officer of the Nigeria Red Cross Society in Bauchi state, Malam Auwal Bashar made the call yesterday at a rally organized to celebrate the 2019 World Red Cross day in Bauchi. Malam Bashar said the state government should in earnest put precautionary measures in motion so as to help mitigate flood disaster and cholera outbreak before the commencement of the rains. “Government should put in place the construction of culverts, dams, reservoirs and channels diverting flood water, called floodways to raise the banks of the possible flood prone rivers,” he advised. According to Bashar, the flood mitigation should also involve the management and control of flood water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of flood walls and flood gates, rather than trying to prevent flooding altogether. He pointed out that with the commencement of early rains there is need for cholera control and awareness campaign before any possible outbreak. “The campaign should be based on the drinking and use of safe water, intermittent washing of hands with soap, use of latrines or burying of human waste and controlling open defecation near any body of water and keeping food covered,” he added. Bashar also charged communities living close to flood prone areas to make provision for gully water and clearing of drainages for safety.
