By Memoye Oghu (Port Harcourt) Commercial tricycle operators in Rivers state under the aegis of Tricycles Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN) are now poised to assist the state government in the fight against insecurity. State Chairman of the association, Comrade Chukwuma Otugbali, who made the disclosure in a chat with the Daily Times in Port Harcourt on Thursday, said every member of the union would henceforth, be identified with a code number that would make it easy to track criminal elements within their fold.“Now that we’re fully unionized, we would be able to help the government to fight insecurity in the state by enlightening our members to assist security agencies with credible information. With code numbers for each of our member, it would be easy to fish out bad elements in our midst. “It is a wrong notion that tricycle operators are used for criminal operations. It’s not tricycles operators, but commercial motor-cyclists that are used for criminal activities. But, people seem to equate tricycle operators with commercial motor-cyclists,” he stated. Otugbali advised members of the union to be diligent in their operations in order to erase this bad image that has been painted about them, even as he assured members of the public that his members are now ready to serve them purposefully. He felicitated with Governor Nyesom Wike on his electoral victory in the just concluded governorship election in the state, adding that the re-election of the governor for a second tenure is a confirmation of his appellation as a performer.However, he also appealed to the governor to assist tricycle operators with soft loans to enable members purchase tricycles which prices have skyrocketed beyond the rich of majority of operators.
