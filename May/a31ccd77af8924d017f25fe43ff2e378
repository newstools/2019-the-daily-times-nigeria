Mathew Dadiya, Abuja Against the expectations of Nigerians, President Muhammadu Buhari has refused to dissolve his cabinet members after the valedictory session held at the Council chamber of the State House Abuja. The Daily Times recalls that the President has directed the ministers to submit their handover notes weeks ago, despite that he told them to remain in office till the eve of his swearing in in May 28, 2019. Buhari told the ministers today during the valedictory session that, “We frequently had heated debate in a quest to achieve our goal. It is this reason that made me retain my cabinet for full term. “You should be proud to have contributed to reclaiming the local government and retiring the economy, introduced the social investment program that is taking millions of Nigerians out of poverty. Be proud of being part of the administration that built roads, rail and many infrastructure. Although today is our last meeting, I urged all of  you to continue working till 28th May when you will formally hand over.” Details later….
