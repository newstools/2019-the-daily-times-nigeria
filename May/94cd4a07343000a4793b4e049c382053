In a related development,  a Senior Programme Officer, Centre For Information Technology and Development(CITAD) , Malam Isah Garba has called on operatives of the National  Drugs  Law Enforcement Agency(NDLEA) to beef up security checks at the nation’s Airports for  real drug pushers to be apprehended and brought to book. Speaking to news men in Kano yesterday, Garba said  the   saga of Zainab Aliyu, a student of Yusuf Maitama Sule, who was detained for months in Saudi-Arabia in connection with the luggage  containing drugs  had left much to be desired in terms of getting  the real owners of the luggage prosecuted adding that their were many more like her in Saudi detention facing a similar fate. According to him,  the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency must intensify their search and surveillance of passengers’ luggage and the environments during boarding and ensure that no luggage was tempered with   after the legal owner has checked it in and that no luggage should escape the screening process  with the real owners identified. He said the Airliners on their part should make sure that luggage under their custody were under effective care in such a way that nobody tamper with them and punish or report to appropriate  agencies any  of their staff or of the company they contacted in packaging luggage found to be tampered with or inserting something into passengers’ luggage
