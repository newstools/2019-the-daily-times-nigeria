Samuel Luka, Bauchi With less than three weeks to the swearing -in of the Bauchi state governor-elect, a political group in the state, Bauchi Assembly of Youths Political Actors (BAYOPA) has charged security agencies to ensure that the event is peaceful and violence free. Comrade Jibrin Sa’id Jibrin, who spoke on behalf of the group said as agencies of government saddled with the responsibility of protecting lives and properties, the security operatives should remain alert to ensure that peace and tranquility prevail throughout the transition period. He said to achieve a peaceful transition, security agents must be exceptionally vigilant, professional and remain focused, adding that “it is only by so doing that members of the public can have confidence in them and their efforts in the provision of security. “This being the case, we make bold to say that the people of Bauchi state deserve the best of security attention from all the security agencies.” According to him, the group was formed to contribute its quota to the peace, development and progress of the state, and therefore, appealed to Islamic clerics to offer special prayers throughout the season of Ramadan fasting for the peace, stability and development of the state and country. “We call on fellow citizens to continue to be supportive, active and positive as regards our collective will to drive the journey towards the Bauchi state of our dream. “With the recent feats attained particularly in our political life where we demonstrated courage, faith, determination and commitment to succeed, we can be right to say that nothing can stop an idea whose time has come to play in Bauchi state,” Jibrin stated.
