By Samuel Luka, Bauchi President of the National Union of Bauchi state Students (NUBASS‎), Comrade Ahmed Shehu Hassan has lamented the non -payment of scholarship to indigent students of the state studying in various tertiary institutions across the country for two years. Comrade Hassan made the lamentation while speaking to journalists on Friday in Bauchi. Hassan, who alleged that only one per cent of the approximate 1.5 million students of Bauchi state origin benefited from the payment of the scholarship in the last two years, added that the beneficiaries were those who had connections in the state scholarship board. “This is because of the corruption in the board and it is not unconnected with the selfish interests of the then national president. It is very sad that scholarship and bursary payments are being neglected by the government, especially in this era when people are struggling for food to eat and the payment of tuition fees is a problem,” he said. The student leader however, urged the students to exercise patience on the matter, appealing to the state Governor-elect, Bala Mohammed to ensure the regular payment of the scholarship to students as they contributed immensely to his victory in the recent governorship election. He accused the outgoing government of creating leadership crisis in the union and appealed to the incoming governor to recognize only the legitimately elected executive of the union. Hassan called on all students in the state to take advantage of the remaining days of Ramadan to pray for the incoming administration to fulfil its manifesto regarding their welfare.
