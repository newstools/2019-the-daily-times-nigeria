The Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked Senator Adeseye Ogunlewe to leave the party if he so desires. The former Minister of Works had described the PDP as an unserious party, saying it is not a party anybody with political future should belong to. However, reacting to Ogunlewe’s statement, Adegbola Dominic, the state factional chairman of the party, said his departure from the party will do the PDP a lot of good. Dominic said: “Such disparaging remarks are unbecoming and not expected from a 75-year-old man who claims to be a leader of the party. Ogunlewe has been publicly supporting and hailing one Segun Adewale (aka) Aeroland, who has been openly declared a non-member of our party by the National Working Committee, and who has been disparaging our leaders and terrorizing them with his thugs. “Ogunlewe has repeatedly lied that he was present at a meeting where I, as state chairman, canvassed support for the candidate of another party. This deliberate falsehood was obviously targeted at creating confusion and disaffection among the party members”. “A respected former state chairman, Capt. Tunji Shelle (rtd), who was present at the said meeting, noted that Ogunlewe was nowhere near the venue of the meeting. He declared that Ogunlewe is a confused man who should go take a rest.” Ogunlewe had earlier denied media reports that he has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying the report that he had dumped the party was not true. He said rumours of his defection was not true, but, he warned that the party was bedeviled with many crises which if not urgently resolved could spark exodus of people from the party.
