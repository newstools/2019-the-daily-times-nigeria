By Moses Oyediran, Enugu The outgoing Vice Chancellor University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Prof. Benjamin Ozumba says he inherited a dysfunctional university from his predecessor in 2014. Prof. Ozumba stated this while giving account of his stewardship for the five years as 14th vice chancellor of the university during a press conference on Monday. “Prior to 2014, the university was listed as dysfunctional, but today and for the third consecutive year since 2016, we are ranked by Webometrics as number one university in Nigeria. “Our enviable position as the best in research publications is still very evident and among the top 1, 500 universities in the world,” he said, adding that his administration met backlog of programmes and courses not accredited, as against now when all the courses are fully accredited. “Today, the story is different as over 100 academic programmes running in this university are fully accredited. I will remain grateful to council members and the university management for their support and cooperation. “Under my stewardship, new faculties were created such as faculty of vocational and technical education and faculty of basic medical science,” he said. The vice chancellor said his first move on assumption of office was to restore peace and tranquility within the campuses as well as improving welfare of staff and students. Ozumba said his administration enhanced knowledge and usage of ICT, creation of new faculties, establishment of a science park, regular and prompt payment of workers’ salaries as well as generation of electricity from waste and manufacturing of the lion laptop. Ozumba said his administration has some completed projects to be inaugurated before his exit on June 14.
