God has revealed himself. I wish Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola well and I know he is a good man. The people of Osun State will enjoy his tenure” Ajomale said further that even if PDP goes to the Supreme Court, APC would win again because the party had all the evidence in their hands. Also, the Assistant Publicity Secretary of Lagos APC, Mr Abiodun Salami, described the judgement as a victory for democracy, saying that judiciary has shown that it is the hope of the common man.

It was a unanimous decision to show that democracy is working, and that the hope of the common man is in the judiciary” “Somebody cannot just come from somewhere and want to get position through crook means. The people of Osun are not stupid. Someone without a genuine certificate cannot govern Osun. APC will continue to win”
