Mathew Dadiya, Abuja Two African leaders would join over 5,000 entrepreneurs at the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), Africa’s foremost champion of entrepreneurship, as it hosts its 5th Annual Forum. The event, which has been recognised as the largest annual gathering of African entrepreneurs, comes up July 2019. According to TEF on Sunday, the two-day event will take place at the iconic Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja. The Forum is the culmination of the annual Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme, which this year mentored, trained and seeded over 3,000 young Africans, selected from over (216,000) applicants. The event provides a unique opportunity for young women and men, from all 54 African countries, to meet, learn and network with the broader African and global entrepreneurship ecosystem. It is also a critical opportunity for political leaders and policymakers to meet, face to face, a new generation of African business leaders, who are transforming Africa’s economic trajectory.
