As head of the observer mission of @EISAfrica to South Africa’s national and provincial elections, I led my team out this morning to observe ballot opening and voting at some locations in Johannesburg. Including the polling centres at Sandton Fire station & Cedarwood of Sandton. pic.twitter.com/xpwjRd3GTe— Goodluck E. Jonathan (@GEJonathan) May 8, 2019
