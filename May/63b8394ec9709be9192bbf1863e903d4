By Our reporter Kano state government has described as false and misleading media reports that said a court in the state nullified the recent appointment of new emirs by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. In a press statement issued Wednesday which was signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Abba Anwar, the government explained that the court ruled that all parties should return to status quo, which to the government means that all appointed emirs should maintain their position. “A misleading story that mischievously emanated from one media organization, which owner is also an interested party concerning the newly appointed emirs of Bichi, Karaye, Rano and Gaya; that a court sitting in Ungogo nullified their appointment is but an aggressive false news item. “The Kano state High Court sitting in Ungogo only ordered for the return to status-quo, which in our side means all appointed emirs maintain their positions,” the statement said. According to the chief press secretary, from the time Gov. Ganduje assented to the law establishing the new emirates up to the time he served them with letters of notification of appointment, he was not served with any court order restraining him from doing that. “The final thing he did to the newly emirs was presentation of staff of office which took place on May 12. After Justice Nasiru Saminu ordered for the return of the status-quo, pending further hearing, the hearing is fixed for June 21,” he said. Cautioning against false information, the state government referred the public and other stakeholders in the state to confirm from the records of the court that issued the order so as to be properly guided on the matter. “Practitioners and members of the public should cross-check this with the Kano state High Court sitting in Ungogo under Justice Nasiru Saminu which gave out this position for further clarification,” he added
