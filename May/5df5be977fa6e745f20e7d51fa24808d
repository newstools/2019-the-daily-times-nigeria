Ukpono Ukpong, Abuja In a bid to improve and encourage the utilization of alternative dispute resolution in resolving conflicts in the nation’s capital, the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has commenced the training of traditional and community leaders in the FCT. Addressing the participants in Abuja, the Minister of FCT, Malam Muhammad Bello urged them to adopt the model in resolving conflicts among Nigerians living in the FCT due to its huge advantages over litigations in courts. He called on the traditional and community leaders to continue to discharge their responsibilities effectively, admonishing them to make good use of the alternative dispute resolution in resolving problems with their neighbours as it was cost effective, takes a shorter time for justice dispensation and resolves disputes amicably, without spoiling relationship between or among those involved. “This workshop, I know will go a long way to ease and guide you in solving most of the conflicts be it family or land issue. “We are also exploring the same mechanism at the FCTA on land issues as we now usually bring the factions together, sit with them and amicably resolve conflicts with one another without spending a kobo,” the minister stated. Malam Bello, who was represented by the Secretary, FCT Area Council Services Secretariat, Sen. Isa Maina recalled that for long it had been the role of traditional rulers in solving conflicts. According to him, the workshop which was done in partnership with Green Horizon Law and Development Consultants would enhance capability of the traditional rulers in discharging their responsibilities effectively as well as resolve conflicts without letting the parties go to court. Director of Training, Green Horizon, Ibrahim Naiya Sada while speaking, noted that the workshop could not have come at a better time because the participants would be able to learn new things in conflict resolution.
