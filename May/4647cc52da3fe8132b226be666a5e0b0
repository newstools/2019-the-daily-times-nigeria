By Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has disclosed plans to launch an investigation into the 16-year activities of the Senate President Bukola Saraki from 2003 when he was elected governor of Kwara state. According to reports, the anti -graft agency has already written a letter to the Kwara state government requesting information on all of Saraki’s earnings during his tenure from 2003 to 2011. The EFCC on its Facebook post did not give reason why it is probing Saraki, but there were insinuations that the development was in connection with his new appointment as the ambassador at large by the International Human Rights Commission. The post reads in part: “For the avoidance of doubt, an investigation into the Senate President’s activities while he held sway as the governor of Kwara state started long before his nomination and emergence as IHRC ambassador. “In fact, the commission’s letter to the Kwara state Government House which sought an inquest into Saraki’s earnings as the state governor from 2003 to 2011 was dated Friday, April 26, 2019, pre-dating his announcement as IHRC ambassador at large which came on Sunday, April 28, 2019, with two clear days. “We wish to restate our resolve to resist distractions from any quarter in our efforts to rid the country of corruption and corrupt elements.” The EFCC and Saraki have been at loggerheads since 2016 when the Senate President ensured that the acting Chairman of the commission, Ibrahim Magu, was not confirmed by the Senate. The commission also gave evidence against Saraki when he was facing trial before the Code of Conduct Tribunal, a case he eventually won. Some of Saraki’s aides have either been arraigned or are facing probe by the EFCC, which claims the probe has nothing to do with politics.
