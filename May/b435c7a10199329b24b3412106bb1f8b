Appolos Christian The League of Anambra Media Practitioners (LAMP) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to confirm the appointment of the current acting Registrar General of the Corporate Affairs Commission, Lady Azuka Azinge as the substantive registrar general of the commission. In a press statement made available to the media in Abuja yesterday and signed by its Convener, Mr Williams Orji, the body regretted that Lady Azinge, who has transformed the commission since she assumed office over a year ago, is still wearing the toga of acting registrar -general, despite numerous transformations on easy of doing business she has introduced in the commission. They mentioned amongst other things some of the innovations to include, the abolition of proficiency certificate requirement, the increment of number of small scale business registration through a new federal government policy, the reduction of the number of hours spent to conduct a search from days to just four hours and the online registration service which can now be done within 24 hours as achievements she has recorded since assuming office. The group wondered why, having done so much to reinvigorate and reposition the CAC, the brain behind such a feat still has her confirmation as substantive chief executive delayed. “Though Lady Azinge is from Anambra state, but going by the number of achievements she has brought to the CAC shows that no previous registrar-general has surpassed her feat. ‘She has brought professionalism and efficiency in the running of the once moribund commission where it can now boast of making more money for the federal government. “Therefore, we ask the President, to speedily confirm her appointment as a way of motivating her for more hard work and innovations in line with the present administration’s economic policies,” the body said.
