The North West Tax Appeal Tribunal sitting in Kaduna on Tuesday began hearing in the N6.1 billion tax evasion case brought against the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, by the Kaduna state Internal Revenue Service (KDIRS). The state revenue service had on January 16, 2014, instituted the case against ABU for failure to implement in full the Pay-As-You-Earn tax table and remit same to the service from 2007 to 2012, amounting to N6.1 billion. ABU had earlier requested for out-of-court settlement and the tribunal chaired by Umar Adamu granted the request and adjourned the case till April 30 for report of settlement or hearing. Counsel to the state revenue service, Francis Kozah, informed the court that the revenue service held series of meetings with the management of the institution, but regretted that both parties failed to reach any substantive settlement and therefore, prayed the court to commence hearing on the five-year long case. The counsel through his first witness tendered before the court the tax audit report 2007 to 2012 which was admitted in evidence and equally, tendered the demand notice to the tune of N6.1 billion in respect of the audit report served on the respondent. Thereafter, he prayed the tribunal to ask the institution to pay all outstanding PAYE arrears, including interest and penalty as stated by law. But, counsel to the university, Christopher Ikpa, requested for a new date to cross examine the witness, a request that was opposed by the prosecution counsel who argued that the witness written disposition has been with the respondent since February 27, 2019. Immediately Kozah made his submission, the defence counsel collapsed following an undisclosed illness, a development which forced the prosecution counsel to accept Ikpaâ€™s request on health ground and asked the court to grant the adjournment as requested. Chairman of the tribunal granted the request and adjourned the case till May 23 for cross examination.
