Doosuur Iwambe The BBC has sacked Danny Baker, saying he showed a “serious error of judgment” over his tweet about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby. The tweet, which he later deleted but which has been circulated on social media, showed an image of a couple holding hands with a chimpanzee dressed in clothes with the caption: “Royal Baby leaves hospital”. The BBC 5 Live presenter was accused of mocking the duchess’s racial heritage. Meanwhile, Baker has claimed that it was a “stupid gag”. The 61-year-old presented a Saturday morning show on the network. The corporation said Baker’s tweet “goes against the values we as a station aim to embody”. It added: “Danny’s a brilliant broadcaster but will no longer be presenting a weekly show with us.” His comment about red sauce references the Sausage Sandwich Game from his 5 Live show, in which listeners choose what type of sauce a celebrity would choose to eat.
