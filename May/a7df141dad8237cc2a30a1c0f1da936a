By Val Okara, Owerri. The Imo state House of Assembly on Thursday suspended 27 elected local council chairmen for failing to honour the summons of the legislature investigating the finances of local governments. The motion to suspend the chairmen was moved by Chika Madumere, member representing Nkwerre State Constituency and was unanimously endorsed by lawmakers at plenary. Sponsor of the motion accused the council chairmen of failing to appear before the House to explain how they have been running the finances of their council areas. Madumere said the suspended chairmen undermined the legislature by failing to honour the summons extended to them. Responding to their suspension, a council chairman who pleaded anonymity confirmed the development in a telephone conversation, saying that they were meeting to review the development.
