Chukwuemeke Iwelunmo Members of the Aeronautical Information Management Association of Nigeria (AIMAN) have decried the non-implementation of aeronautical information system automation more than 10 years after conception. A release signed by the President of AIMAN, Williams Ngerem and made available to the media to herald this year’s aeronautical information system celebration, said the aeronautical information system automation remained critical in the overall regularity and reliability of aeronautical data globally He said it was disheartening to note that for over 10 years since its inception, the much talked about aeronautical information system automation was yet to come on stream having suffered several stillbirths. “Without prejudice to current efforts by the federal government to realize this laudable dream, it is pertinent to note that Nigeria as the giant of African cannot continue to lag behind when several other African countries have embraced automation in aeronautical information dissemination,” Ngerem stated. He enjoined Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) management to liaise with relevant organizations to see to the final attainment of aeronautical information management in Nigeria at the shortest possible time. “I also charge the federal government to use its good offices to accelerate the implementation of the aeronautical information management project so that Nigeria can take its rightful position in the comity of nations,” the statement added. While thanking the executive council of AIMAN for their hard work and determination in taking the association to enviable heights and for a successful one -year in office, Ngerem acknowledged the immense cooperation and support of all its members nationwide. The theme of this year’s aeronautical information system day is: “The benefits of automation to aeronautical information management,” and the event will be chaired by Managing Director/Chief Executive of Aero Contractors, Capt. Ado Sanusi.
