By Amaka Agbu, Port Harcourt Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state and his Benue state counterpart, Samuel Ortom, on Thursday held a closed-door meeting at the Government House, Port Harcourt. Although details of the one- hour long meeting were not immediately made available to the press, it was gathered that both leaders discussed issues of inter-state development. Recall that Governor Wike, early last year paid a solidarity visit and donated N200 million to Ortom to help alleviate the sufferings of over 100, 000 persons displaced from their ancestral homes by suspected rampaging Fulani herdsmen. Gov. Wike said during the visit that he was also in Benue to commiserate with the state over the New Year’s killings of about 73 people by suspected herdsmen after which the two governors took a drive to the mass grave site where the victims were buried. Wike’s solidarity visit opened a fresh friendship and partnership between the two governors who had earlier engaged each other in a fierce verbal war.
