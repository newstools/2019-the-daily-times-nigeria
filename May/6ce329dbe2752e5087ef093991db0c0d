By Samuel Luka, Bauchi A group known as Ningi Emirate Progressive Forum has called on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the speakership of the Bauchi state House of Assembly as well as that of the secretary to the state government to Ningi Emirate. The forum made the call during a courtesy visit to the Emir of Ningi, Alhaji Yunusa Muhammad Danyaya in his palace on Friday. Comrade Khalid Muhammad, who led the group to the palace of the emir decried that Ningi Emirate is being marginalized in terms of distribution of projects and zoning of key government positions since the return of democracy in 1999. He explained that for 20 years, Ningi has never produced a governor, deputy governor, speaker of the state House of Assembly or secretary to the state government despite the fact that it is the second largest local government in the state. Comrade Khalid also lamented that the positions of speaker of the state House of Assembly and secretary to the state government that are being zoned to the central zone for years went to Misau Emirate and Bauchi Emirate while Ningi is being sidelined. “It is high time the two parties bring to an end this marginalization by rewarding the people of Ningi Emirate Council with the positions,” he said. The forum also requested the support and prayers of the emir to ensure Ningi Emirate is given its desired position in the scheme of affairs in Bauchi state. Responding, the Emir, Alhaji Yunusa Muhammad Danyaya thanked the group for the visit and their commitment as well as foresight towards the progress of Ningi emirate. He said that the Ningi emirate has been left behind in all aspects of human development despite its role in the formation of all political structures and governments in the state. The emir who said Ningi’s history and population has given it a special place in the country wondered why it is been neglected.
