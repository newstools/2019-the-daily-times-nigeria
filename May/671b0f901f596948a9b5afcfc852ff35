Mohamed Salah left on a stretcher after an aerial collision with Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka during the 3-2 win. The Premier League’s top scorer was able to watch some of the game in the dressing room after his 73rd-minute departure for Divock Origi, who scored the winner to send the Reds top of the table. “Mo got the hip of the goalie in his head and then was on the ground,” said the Reds boss. “The doctor had to make a decision – on the pitch or off the pitch – and the decision was off the pitch and we accept that of course. “When we came in, he was sitting in the dressing room and had watched the game. He was then fine but of course we have to wait. He got a proper knock in that situation. We’ll have to see.”
