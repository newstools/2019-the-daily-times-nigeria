After trying in vain for four times to become president of Kenya, Raila Odinga says stories that he has declared to contest the 2022 presidential election is mere rumour as there has been no such declaration. Odinga who is the main opposition leader and his party, the ODM had earlier indicated that Raila will face off with Deputy President William Ruto, Jubilee party’s presumed 2022 presidential candidate. Speaking at his rural home in Apoda Farm, Siaya county, where he held a meeting with a delegation of leaders from Nakuru county on Saturday, Raila also clarified he did not strike any 2022 deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta when the March 9, 2018, handshake was hatched. “I have not said I will vie for presidency. Decision of succession cannot be anchored on two people’s agreement which the majority of Kenyans were not party to,” he said.
