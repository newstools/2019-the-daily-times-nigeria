Chukwuemeke Iwelunmo Stakeholders in the aviation sector have called for sanction against Azman air that defiled the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority regulation by flying into closed Kebbi airport. The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) had last week closed the airport following accumulated debts and sent out notice to airmen to stop using the airport. Stakeholders who spoke with Daily Times expressed shock over the display of arrogance by the pilot of the aircraft thereby endangering the lives of passengers on board the aircraft as there was neither fire cover in case of emergencies nor aviation security men to screen passengers for safety. One of the stakeholders, the Secretary General of Association of Nigerian Aviation Professionals (ANAP), Comrade Abdulrasaq Saidu called for the withdrawal of the pilot’s licence and to ground the airline for not adhering to safety regulations Saidu said that after investigation by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority that the airline should also be fined for gross violation. According to Saidu, the pilot put the lives of passengers in risk asking how and who screened the passengers at the airport that was closed. He waned airlines not to take the industry to the days of crashes in the country by not adhering to rules and regulation. According to Saidu, once a Notice To Air Men (NOTAM) was issued, the pilot ought to know that the airport was “a no go area” because there would be no facilities to bring the aircraft down. Another stakeholder who spoke on the condition of anonymity, advise NCAA as a regulator to investigate and take necessary punitive measures to ensure that such breach does not repeat itself again. He noted that the airport was closed as a result of huge debt and that there was no reason whatsoever for the airline to had flown into the state owned airport. He called for proper interrogation of all the people on duty for the two days that the airline operated into the closed Kebbi airport.
