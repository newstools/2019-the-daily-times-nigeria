The absence of Justice Yusuf Halilu of an FCT High Court, Maitama, on Monday, stalled the trial of Sen. Dino Melaye and an alleged husband killer, Maryam Sanda, on Monday.The judge was absent due to his official engagement on election tribunal duty in Ogun state. While the court rescheduled the trial of Sanda until June 11, Melaye’s case was fixed for hearing on June 17. Senator Melaye was on January 22 arraigned by the inspector-general on police before Justice Halilu.He was arraigned on an eight-count charge bordering on alleged conspiracy, resistance to arrest, failure to honour police invitations and intentionally giving false information to the public.The police had alleged that the senator conspired with one Silas Omenka on December 28, 2018 to commit an offence of illegal obstruction to lawful arrest, thereby committing an offence contrary to Section 97 of the Penal Code.Melaye was said to have intentionally resisted lawful arrest, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 172 of the Penal Code. He was also alleged to have intentionally tweeted with the intention of inciting the public against the police.The police alleged that Melaye tweeted that the police inspector-general planned to arrest and inject him to death, an allegation the prosecution said was false and was punishable under Section 416 of the Penal Code.The senator, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him by the police.Also, Justice Halilu had on April 4 while ruling on a no-case submission filed by Sanda and her co-defendants, discharged Maryam’s mother, Maimuna Aliyu, brother, Aliyu Sanda and housemaid, Sadiya Aminu.They were earlier charged with concealment of evidence by cleaning the blood of the late Bilyaminu from the scene of the crime.Halilu further ruled that Maryam Sanda, who was charged with culpable homicide punishable with death for allegedly killing her husband, Bilyaminu Bello, had a case to answer and as such should enter her defence.Maryam was alleged to have stabbed her late husband to death with a knife in their residence in early 2018.
