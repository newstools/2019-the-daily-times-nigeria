Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja Beautiful Nollywood actress and mother of two, Annie Idibia has lost her dear father to the cold hands of death. Annie shared the news on her Instagram page, announcing his demise. She revealed that he died after losing his battle with cancer. She wrote: “R I P Daddy. You Fought Hard #cancersucks #thePainIsGone” Recounting the time she spent with her father, she said; “This year started for me quite tough. I spent the first three months of this year in the hospital with my father because he had been sick for a while but God has been great and I am grateful. I am actually closer to my mother than my father because she raised us single-handedly. My father is still my father and since he was sick we had to rally round him. Growing up with only my mother really affected my life and I suffered and I do not ever want my children to face the agony of not having both parents together because it was so hard for us. Even right now, the way the world is, children are more enlightened than we were in our days, so the pressure would be harder on the kids from broken homes right now. I do not want my children to ever experience that.” It would be recalled that Annie recently called fans to order on social media when she said she didn’t want to be referred to as just 2Face’s wife. The dark-skinned beauty reminded them that she has an identity outside that of her husband’s and also pointed out that she has other achievements going on for her that shouldn’t be relegated just because she is 2Face’s wife.
