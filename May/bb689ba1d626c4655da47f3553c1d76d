I thank God for all those who encouraged me to go to school when my wife described me as error to her life. I want to thank Ijaw people for supporting me. I will read up to the university level,” Seribo Adelabu said. Confirming that he had been surviving with his wheelbarrow business, Seribo, said “I am still pushing my wheelbarrow to make ends meet and pay my school fees.
