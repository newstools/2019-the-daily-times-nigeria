Ahmad Sorondinki, Kano The Kano state House of Assembly on Monday initiated moves to create four additional emirate councils in the state that would elevate the current status of some district heads to first class emirs. At todayâ€™s plenary, the Speaker of the House, Kabiru Alhassan Rurum read a petition brought to the House for consideration by Ibrahim Salisu and others, requesting the House to start the move to create new emirates in the state. The move sought the nod of the legislators to accede to the demand, which was eventually presented on the floor of the House with the lawmakers making their individual contributions for and against the petition before the House adjourned its sitting to Tuesday for further continuation of debate. Presently, about 13 legislators have already assented to the petition while the former Speaker of the House, Isiyaku Ali Danja, who is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vehemently resisted the prayer, urging his colleagues in the House to maintain the status quo by allowing the existence of only one emirate council to remain in the state. According to the petitioner, his demand is in consonance with the Kano Emirate Council Amendment law, a position the House Majority Leader, Baffa Babba Danagundi concurred with.
