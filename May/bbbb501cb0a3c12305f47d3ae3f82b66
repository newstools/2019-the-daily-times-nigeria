By Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja In its bid to stem protests against the office of the Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta and Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, Niger Delta ex-agitators for Peace Organization, an international umbrella body of ex-agitators has warned “conflict entrepreneurs” in the region to stop instigating the youth against constituted authorities or face the wrath of the people. The Country Representative of the organization, Comrade (Amb) George Adioni Sinclair cautioned that “on no account should any politician instigate violence in the Niger Delta region by using ex-agitators as a means to achieve their business/political relevance.” He informed that the ex -agitators were aware that even some registered vendors with the Presidential Amnesty Programme have eventually turned out to become conflict entrepreneurs who are bent on instigating crisis in the Niger Delta to draw attention for selfish reasons. “These conflict entrepreneurs operate both as economic and political actors, in that they foment and fuel violence as a pathway for attaining economic and political power,” he said. He lamented that such vendors in the Presidential Amnesty Programme go behind to incite beneficiaries in the programme with an intention of cajoling the amnesty coordinator to award juicy contracts to them at the expense of the programme. “Some of them lobby for positions of economic and political power after the cessation of hostilities they instigated earlier. Recent developments in the amnesty office is a case in point,” Adioni added. According to Comrade Adioni, the earlier the amnesty office identifies such conflict entrepreneurs who parade themselves as contractors and friends of the special adviser/coordinator of the programme the better.
