Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja The Abuja zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has secured 16 convictions between November 2018 and April 2019, and recovered more than N100 million. According to Umar Hadejia, Head of the EFCC Abuja zonal office, the achievement comes a few months after the anti-graft agency formally designated the Wuse II office of the EFCC as the Abuja zonal office following the commissioning and movement to the new head office complex at Jabi, Abuja. Hadejia, who made the disclosure on Friday in Abuja, said that the zone has recovered a total cash of N92, 800, 078, $42, 543 and €1, 000 during the period under review. He further added that within the period, the zone recovered the following items; Mercedes Benz C300, Mercedes Benz C240, Lexus salon car, three HP pavilion laptops, Dell laptop, three Apple MAC book laptops, nine iphone X smart phones, seven Android phones, Apple ear pods, iwatches, refrigerators, television sets, generators, expensive wrist watches and jewelries worth millions of Naira. He said: “The zone has continued to speed up efforts to ensure that fraudsters are made to face the wrath of the law and in situations where funds are recovered, victims are refunded and where the court deems fit, funds are returned back to the federal government coffers. “We hereby urge citizens in Nigeria and the Diaspora to ensure they report any suspected economic or financial crime to the commission for immediate investigation and prosecution.”
