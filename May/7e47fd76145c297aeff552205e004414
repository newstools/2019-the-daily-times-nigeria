His score is just one point behind the best overall score recorded by Franklin Ekene. Emmanuel represented Ambassador College, Ota, Ogun state at the Cowbellpedia mathematics competition at the junior category as a 13-year-old in 2016 and returned in 2018 to compete in the senior category. In that second attempt, he got to the final stage where he was outwitted by Juliet Ekoko and Enoch Adelekan, both of the same Ambassadors College.
