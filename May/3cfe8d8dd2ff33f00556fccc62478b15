Temitope Adebayo Due to sustained profit taking in the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), the equities market segment on Tuesday recorded a depreciated market capitalisation of N136 billion to close at N10.959 trillion. The All-Share Index (ASI) shed 361.32 basis points, representing a dip of 1.22 per cent to close at 29,159.74 basis points. Yesterday’s performance was influenced by price depreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are, Nestle Nigeria, Dangote Cement, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) and NASCON Allied Industries. Analysts at Cordros Capital Limited noted that “In the absence of a positive catalyst, we guide investors to trade cautiously in the short term. However, stable macro-economic fundamentals and compelling valuation remain supportive of recovery in the mid-to-long term.” Analysts at APT Securities and Funds Limited said that “The NSE-ASI extends negative outlook amidst good fundamentals. However, the positive first quarter result had an ample effect on company’s stock prices. Therefore, there is still room for more up days. Investors are thereby encouraged to take a medium to long term position in fundamentally justifiable stocks.” However, market breadth was positive with 26 gainers against 19 losers.
