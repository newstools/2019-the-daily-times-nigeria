By Tunde Opalana, Abuja Governor of Bayelsa state and Chairman of the South South Governors Forum, Henry Seriake Dickson has called on the 36 governors to adhere to the principle of rotation in the election of a new leader for the Nigerian Governors Forum. The governor said in a statement by his Special Adviser, Media Relations, Fidelis Soriwei, that the decision on who should be the next chairman of the forum should be guided by the time tested principle of rotation between the North and South. The governor said that the next chairman of the NGF should come from the South with the end of the tenure of Gov. Abdulazeez Yari òf Zamfara state. The governor added that governors elected under the platform of the PDP would not contest the position in consonance with the precedence that the NGF chairman should be a ranking governor from the ruling political party. He stressed that the PDP governors would not make any move to endanger the time honoured principle guiding the emergence of the chairman of the NGF, but noted however, that the next NGF chairman should emerge preferably through consensus among the members of the forum. He said that “I am calling on the governors who would assemble today to take a decision on the chairmanship of the governor’s forum to be guided by the time tested principle of rotation between the North and the South. “Now that the Alhaji Abdulazeez Yari, governor òf Zamfara state would be ending his tenure, we expect that the next chairman should come from the South.”
