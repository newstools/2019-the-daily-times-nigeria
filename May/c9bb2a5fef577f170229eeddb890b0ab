Kasara Chukwuma, Lagos Chief Medical Director of the Lagos state University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, Prof. Adetokunbo Fabamwo, has expressed concern at the rate at which many Nigerian-trained medical doctors are migrating to other countries in search of greener pastures. According to Prof. Fabamwo, only 40, 000 out of the 91, 000 doctors captured on the register of the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) are practicing in the country. He said the number was grossly inadequate and far from the 237, 000 doctors needed for Nigeria to achieve universal health coverage. Prof. Fabamwo disclosed this in Lagos during the ordinary general meeting of the Medical Guild Association of Doctors under the employment of the Lagos state government with the theme: “Challenges of inadequate human resources in the health sector: Way forward.” The LASUTH boss who was the keynote speaker at the event, said that “there are about 40, 000 doctors that are practicing in Nigeria now. So, where are the remaining 51, 000 since the MDCN has 91, 000 names on its register? “It is interesting to note that 80 per cent of those 51, 000 are abroad while 20 per cent have been affected by internal brain drain. Internal brain drain is where a doctor stops practicing medicine and starts doing something else. He advised the federal government to declare an emergency in the health sector and to also reappraise the sector’s master plan, just as he recommended a special welfare package for all health workers while urging the government to implement the National Health Act. In his remarks, Chairman of the Medical Guild, Dr. Babajide Saheed, urged the Lagos state government to take the issue of brain drain in the state very seriously and charged the incoming government to make the employment of doctors a priority. “The state is seriously faced with shortage of doctors as many of them are leaving the system every day because of the work load. We want this to be addressed urgently,” he said.
