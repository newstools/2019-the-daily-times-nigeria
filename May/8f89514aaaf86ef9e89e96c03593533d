The suspects, who were arrested last Friday, at their hideout in Agbowa area of Ogijo, were carrying out an initiation when police stormed the scene. The arrested suspects, Olagboye Abidemi, 32, Olasemojo Michael, 28, and Wasiu Waheed, 23, had in their possession, one jack knife, one blood stained silver knife, one female underwear tied with charms and other assorted charms. Confirming the arrest of the suspects, the Oguns State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi said the arrest of the suspects was in continuation of the command’s war against cultism and other violent crimes. He said, “The DPO Ogijo Division, CSP Muhammed Suleman Baba, while leading his men of ‘Operation Puff Adder ‘ on routine patrol got information about the hideout of the cult group, where they usually initiate new members. “The place was subsequently stormed and three members of the group were arrested. The arrested cultists have all confessed their membership of Eiye fraternity.” Briefed on the issue, the state commissioner of police, CP Bashir Makama, has ordered the transfer of the suspects to Anti-kidnapping/Cultists Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, for discreet investigation. The CP therefore warned that the state will no longer be conducive for any violent group as the command will be taking the battle to their doorstep.
