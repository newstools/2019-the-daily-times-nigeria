Nosa Akenzua, Asaba Rampaging cultists in Ogwashi Uku in Delta state on Wednesday evening allegedly killed a staff of the state polytechnic. The victim, identified as “Biggy” was allegedly shot thrice on the chest by the alleged cultists as he was coming out from a shopping centre where he had gone to do some shopping for himself and his family members. A student of the polytechnic, Chukwudi Emeka, who spoke to our correspondent, said that the late staff was humble and resourceful, adding that the cultists killed him for no justifiable reason. Officials of the polytechnic who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the lecturer was killed by cultists during a rampage in the community, adding that the victim sometimes last month, was allegedly warned by unknown persons who claimed he was too strict while invigilating examinations. However, Rector of the polytechnic, Prof. Stella Chiemeke, who spoke to journalists in the school, assured that the school authority will get to the root of the incident and dispelled as untrue rumours that cultists have taken over the school. “We don’t have cultists in this polytechnic, we have been able to tame them and our security agencies are working very hard to protect our students and staff. It’s unfortunate that “Biggy” was killed by suspected cultists,” she added. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Onovuwakpoyeya Onome, who confirmed the incident, said investigation was ongoing with a view to ensuring that the cultists are arrested.
