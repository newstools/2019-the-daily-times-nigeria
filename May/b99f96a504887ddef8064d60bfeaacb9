Godwin Anyebe Public Relations professionals in Nigeria have been urged to be conscious of the disruption in the industry that is challenging long-held conventions, which will foster the attainment of growth and respect among their clients and counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was the keynote speaker at the Brandcomfest 2019, under the theme: “Digital Disruption and the Future of Public Relation Practice.” Modupe, known for his creative and innovative practice in the public relations industry affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business strategy as the disruption in the industry is real, and the operating modules are fluid. He said those who failed to flow with changing trends might become irrelevant or extinct. He described disruption as an underground process that goes unnoticed but would eventually happen to change the existing narrative. “It is either you are consumed in the process or you are a champion, hence the awareness of the happening around us should not be taking for granted,” he admonished. He explained that since PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, it could be likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. Modupe then challenged his professional colleagues: “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves: what do we really do?  With the constant disruption that occurs in this profession of ours, we need to change the way we do our business to avert going out of extinction.” He was the keynote speaker at the PR session of the two-day summit and panellists included Managing Director Precise Communications, Bolaji Okusaga; CEO BHM Group, Ayeni Adekunle; and Group CEO Red Media, Adebola Williams.
