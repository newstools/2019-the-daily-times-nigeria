The Kano state government is conducting a survey on the Almajiri school system in the state as part of its renewed effort to sanitize the system. Chairman of the Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, Mr. Muhuyi Magaji, which is carrying out the survey, disclosed this to journalists in Kano. Magaji said the research was being conducted in collaboration with a coalition of civil society organizations, disclosing that the survey which was being conducted under the open government partnership, when completed would serve as a policy direction for the state government. The chairman of the commission said the exercise was embarked upon with a view to identifying the problems of the system and street begging as well as advising government on what to do. He said the anti-graft agency was saddled with the responsibility of collating public opinion or suggestions, hence the decision to conduct the survey. “After the survey, we will package the data collected and forward to the government and it is expected to serve as a policy direction for government in the next four years. So, during the survey we will focus on two main issues: Almajiri/street begging and drug abuse, especially among the youth,” he added.
