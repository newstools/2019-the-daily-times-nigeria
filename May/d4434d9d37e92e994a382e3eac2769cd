Our correspondent The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that 132 companies oil and gas on Thursday submitted bids to acquire rights to lift the nation’s crude oil for the 2019/2020. This was disclosed by the Group General Manger, Public Affairs Department of the Corporation, Ndu Ughamadu during the ceremonial opening of the bids in Abuja performed by the Group Managing Director, Maikanti Baru. The tender for the one-year contracts, also known as direct sale, direct-purchase (DSDP), was issued in March. NNPC extended the 2018 contracts through June of this year. The companies that are competing for the rights include local and international concerns. The winners of the bid would each have allocations from the 445,000 barrels per day of Nigeria’s crude oil originally meant for domestic refining. At the ceremony, Baru said the aim was to maximise the value of the country’s crude oil for the benefit of Nigerians, adding that the bid which is the third since the DSDP scheme began in 2016, aligns with the present administration’s quest for transparency in the oil and gas industry. He said that between 2016 and March 2019, about 29.5 million metric tons (or 39 billion litres) of petroleum products have been supplied under the DSDP scheme, which he said represents over 90 per cent of the national requirement of about 55 million litres daily.
