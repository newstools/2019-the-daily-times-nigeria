Agency report Churches in Ghana have been warned of a potential terrorist attack by a jihadist group, Salafi-Jihadist. The Africa Center for Security and Intelligence Studies (ACSIS) handed the warning, saying the terror group based in Burkina Faso, has been moving in and out of Ghana’s borders over the past four months. The Centre also said the immediate targets are likely to be churches in the Northern region, and that the terrorists are likely to operate from the mining zones. “On February 15, 2019, the group killed a Spanish priest, as well as four Burkinabe customs officers at a checkpoint at Nohao near the Ghana border. The group also burnt three vehicles in the process. “The jihadists also launched an attack on a church in Burkina Faso on April 29, 2019, when gunmen opened fire inside the church killing the pastor, two of his sons and three other worshipers. “The attack was the second in April 2019 alone following the killing of four in an attack on April 5, 2019, on a Catholic church,” the Centre added.
