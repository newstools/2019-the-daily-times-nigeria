Godwin Anyabe Experts in the Out of Home, OOH, industry have decried the inability of the Federal Government to create an enabling environment and invest in critical areas that would boost the industry. They also argued that the inability to have an accurate measurement matrix was another major challenge facing stakeholders in the industry. They disclosed these at the 2019 Brandcomfest themed: “Digital Disruption & The Future of Brands & Marketing Communications”. The event was held recently in Lagos Lagos. The Managing Director, Ocean Outdoor, Babs Fagade, lamented that the Federal Government has not created an enabling environment for the OOH to thrive, adding that the level of investment in the industry is abysmally low. Mr Fagade pointed out that poor client base is also a major problem as most billboards in Lagos State had stopped running because there was little or no patronage from clients. “The government is not doing enough in helping the OOH industry. They have not done a lot of investment. Government funding in terms of infrastructure is really a course of concern to us as stakeholders in the OOH industry,” said. Also speaking, the Managing Director, Inventmedia, Kunle Adesina stressed that accurate measurement metrix is one of the biggest challenges because clients are more aggressive about their Return On Investment, ROI at the moment. Mr Adesina pointed out that in the last 24 months, a lot of advertising spend has moved from the OOH sector to other sectors of the IMC because of the challenge of measurement. “We need to learn how to work with Google analytics. There are so many data around us. We really need to measure the ads on our billboard to give value to our clients. These days, clients dictate to us and they want their campaigns measured and for so many years, we were making money but we did not see the need to invest in various tools that we can use to measure our campaigns and this is affecting us right now”, he said.
