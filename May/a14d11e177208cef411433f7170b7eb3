All these are antics of desperate persons trying to cause panic and confusion among candidates and the general public. ”We are not going to succumb to such rumours as we remain focused in ensuring that we achieve what we have set out to do. ”After the examination, the board embarked on a screening to determine any form of examination malpractice and infractions by both candidates and examination centres. This is what has been delaying the release of the results’’. Benjamin urged candidates to be calm and wait for their results to be released soon.
