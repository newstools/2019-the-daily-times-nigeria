Tunde Opalana, Abuja Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar has raised an alert that plans are afoot by unscrupulous and anti-democratic elements to contrive skirmishes in the coming weeks aimed at smearing his personality. Media Adviser to the former Vice President, Paul Ibe in a press statement on Thursday said that it was becoming revealing the grand plot being orchestrated by some agents of evil to stage-manage pockets of upsets targeted at attacking the reputation of Atiku. The statement stated that Atiku was blowing the whistle now as an early warning alert of the grandiose scheme being put together by some unscrupulous elements aimed at jeopardizing his reputation in the coming days and weeks. “By the merit of what is beginning to unfold, there are plans to create some upsets across the country whereby alleged perpetrators of such crimes will engage in phantom name dropping of Atiku Abubakar and some senior personalities in the Peoples Democratic Party. “Already, we are abreast of some other plans to plant fictitious stories in some mushroom media outlets aimed at discrediting Atiku and his political party, the PDP. “It therefore, becomes preponderant that we alert the public of this demonic plan and to say that it will be imprudent to compromise the peace and security of Nigerians in order to score a cheap political goal. “Towards this end, and for the umpteenth time, we call on the federal government to be awake to its responsibilities of providing security and ensuring peace, and to desist from actions and utterances that are capable of exposing our fault lines. “It is very unsettling that senior administration officials, especially those who are the mouth piece of government will make reckless, but calculated comments to tarnish the image of Atiku Abubakar and government will sit idly on it. “With the conclusion reached by Premium Times’ investigative reporting that there is no evidentiary prove to back the claim by Lai Mohammed that the opposition was planning to upstage the government, we demand that the information minister should be arrested for raising false alarm and an apology rendered to Atiku Abubakar and the PDP,” the statement added.
