By Patrick Okohue The Senator representing Kebbi South Senatorial district in the upper chamber of the National Assembly, Senator Bala Ibn Na’allah, yesterady said that there would never be revolution in Nigeria as feared by his colleague. Na’allah was reacting to a motion on the likelihood of revolution in Nigeria by Senator Chukwuka Utazi. Utazi of Enugu North had sponsored a motion expressing fears that the poor would ignite a revolution against the rich in Nigeria if nothing was done to close the gaps between the rich and the poor. Na’allah maintained that the world history has shown that those behind revolution anywhere were selfless people, saying that in Nigeria’s case, it was criminals that were having a field day. “Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, I disagree with Utazi’s position that bandits and kidnappers would instigate revolution in Nigeria. No, never.” But, Senator Emmanuel Bwacha, throwing his weight behind Utazi’s position, reminded the chambers that criminals would always have area of converge, confirming that revolution may be in the making. According to him, poor people are more and they could easily form an opinion on steps to take against the society. He further observed that elite’s children will continue to benefit from jobs creation at the expense of poor children. “Even if government creates jobs as we are saying, it is the elite’s children that will be employed. The question is where are the children of the poor?” Bwacha asked.
