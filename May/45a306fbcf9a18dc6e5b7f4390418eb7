By Nosa Akenzua, Asaba The Bishop of the Asaba Anglican Diocese, Bishop Justus Mogekwu on Tuesday in Asaba, said that critics of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) involvement in partisan politics should do a rethink because CAN is the political arm of the church in Nigeria and the fact is not negotiable. Bishop Mogekwu, who spoke to our correspondent, said that CAN is an association of Christians that are committed to the well-being of Christians and its opinion about Christians should be respected. He stated that “one is a Christian does not mean that one should be shut out on the political issues of the country. Going down memory lane, the world over and the history of the church cannot be separated from politics; therefore, for anybody to criticize CAN for having a say in the political issues of Nigeria would amount to living in a world of ignorance. “Therefore, as equal stakeholders with Muslims and in the Nigeria project, CAN is interested in the political future and well-being of Christians and would do everything within the land to protect the political interests of Christians.” While saying that Christianity is not a violent religion, Bishop Mogekwu however, condemned the incessant killings and harassment of Christians, particularly, in the north and warned that the humility of Christians should not be taken for granted by anybody or the government. He added that respect begets respect and the Christians will continue to have a say in the political issues and in the interest of the country.
