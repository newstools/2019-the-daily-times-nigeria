By Henry Omunu, Abuja The House of Representatives on Tuesday resolved to investigate the killing of 11 members of the Boys Brigade during an Easter procession in Gombe state. This resolution follows the adoption of a motion sponsored under matters of urgent public importance by the Chairman, House Committee on Electoral and Political Parties Matters, Rep. Aishatu Dukku. Rep. Dukku while recalling the April 21 incident, said the innocent boys were in a procession, when a car rammed into them, killing 11 of them instantly and injuring several others. According to her, there were allegations that “the driver of the car who was later identified as an official of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps shot at the boys before ramming his car into the procession. “The driver of the car had a heated debate with the children before they made way for him to pass, only for him in a feat of rage, to turn and drive into them,” she lamented while praying the House to investigate the matter. After adopting the motion, the House mandated its committee on internal affairs to carry out the investigation and make appropriate recommendations to the House within two weeks. The House however, extended its condolences to the government and people of Gombe state.
