Henry Omunu, Abuja The management of the National Assembly after intense pressure has succumbed by agreeing to shelve plans to introduce stringent accreditation measures for journalists covering both the Senate and House of Representatives. A source privy to the meeting held by management with leaders of the press corps of both chambers disclosed that “all is set for the clerk of the National Assembly to drop the idea. “The Clerk to the National Assembly, Sank Omolori told us that as a leader he was going to take responsibility for the action though it was never approved by him. “He promised to go into the whole matter and get back to us before the close of work today(Tuesday) to douse the issue once and for all. ” As it is,  the plan has been dropped as all those fingered in the matter are already denying being responsible for the obnoxious guidelines meant to stifle the media.
