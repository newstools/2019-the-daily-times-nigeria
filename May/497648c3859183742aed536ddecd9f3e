By Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja The federal government has announced that it plans to establish a new counter terrorism unit base in Kaduna state. Acting Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, who made this disclosure during a meeting of Northern Traditional Rulers in Kaduna state on Tuesday, said that the aim is to provide additional manpower and firepower in the renewed fight against criminal elements, especially along the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway Adamu also called for the adoption of a potent crime management strategy modelled on the concept of community policing in which policing functions are citizens-centered and community driven. He stated that even though the police have achieved major successes in addressing security and safety threats in recent times, especially since the launch of ‘Operation Puff Adder,’ a citizens-centered and community policing approach will lead to more sustainable successes in the management of internal safety and security threats. According to him, the community policing model envisaged for the country will involve the establishment and utilization of the special constables as provided for in the Police Act. He reiterated that the special constables model, mirrored after the police community support officers’ standard in the United Kingdom policing architecture, will be tailored to align with the existing traditional security structure in Northern Nigeria. The special constables according to him, will be drawn from members of the community to serve as voluntary community police officers under the coordination of the police. Responding, Governor Nasir el-Rufai commended the police chief on the achievements of ‘Operation Puff Adder’ and promised to support the police in the establishment of the counter terrorism unit base and assist in the acquisition of the needed modern crime fighting technology to fight crimes in the state. The meeting which was organized to deliberate on critical security issues, especially as it affects the North had in attendance, the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar as the chairman, top Northern traditional rulers, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, the Governor el-Rufai, Minister of Defence, Brig. Gen Mansur Muhammad Dan Ali (rtd) and other top government functionaries.
