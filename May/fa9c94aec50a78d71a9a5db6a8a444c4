Chukwuemeke Iwelunmo Azman air has violated the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) regulation by flying into the closed Kebbi airport over the weekend. The airline it was gathered, flouted the Notice To Air Men (NOTAM) issued last week by the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) to all operating airlines in the country warning them not to fly into Kebbi and Gombe airports following over N800 million debts owed the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN). Investigation revealed that Azman air flew into Kebbi airport on Friday and Sunday putting the lives of passengers on board at risk as none of the passengers was screened as the aviation security personnel have been withdrawn from the airport. A reliable source told Daily Times that the airline disregarded the NOTAM to fly into the Kebbi airport without fire cover putting the passengers in danger. It was gathered the air traffic controller informed the pilot about the closure of the airport without fire cover and aviation security personnel at the but the pilot still went ahead to land the aircraft without the services of FAAN. The general manager public affairs NCAA, Mr Sam Adurogboye told Daily Times that the organisation has reached out to the Kebbi airport and investigation was ongoing to determine the sanction to be taken against the airline. But aviation experts have frowned at the action of pilot saying it was a violation that warranted sanctions and urged NCAA to take action immediately. Before the airport was closed May 1, FAAN got NAMA and NCAA informed about the debts owed the agency by two airports, Gombe and Kebbi and the intention of FAAN to sanction the airport and NOTAM was issued to effect the closure. This led to the withdrawal of both fire and rescue and aviation security personnel from the airport. Kebbi airport is a state-owned airport
