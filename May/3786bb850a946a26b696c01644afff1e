Ladesope Ladelokun Software giant, Microsoft, is set to launch a new  command line application  named “Windows Terminal”, which is expected to displace and replace the current Command Prompt and PowerShell programmes soon. Microsoft announced the new application at its Build 2019 developer conference, noting that the application would be available in mid-June. Microsoft revealed that it has  more features which it plans on adding to the new Windows Terminal, and also expects the Microsoft Community to add their own feature to the open source software. The new features in the new Windows Terminal are support for multiple tabs, multiple profiles and Graphics Processing Unit , accelerated text rendering that allows the use of emojis. According to tech giant, the reason for creating a new terminal is the inability to implement further “meaningful improvements” to the old console’s User Interface without “breaking the world.” In a related development, the software giant has launched a private preview version of a new online code editor named ” Visual Studio Online”. This platform is based on the open source visual studio code desktop code editor,and will support all extensions supported by the original editor as well as IntelliCode support. Microsoft states that its visual studio online editor is a companion to the standard visual studio platform and is positioned to aid in sharing information as well as making quick edits or reviewing pull requests. The platform would have a similar interface to visual studio code and would support liveshare, enabling various collaborative features.
