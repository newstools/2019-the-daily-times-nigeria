By Amaka Agbu, Port Harcourt The Rivers state Governor, Nyesom Wike has stated that the country would have made greater progress in terms of development if the federal government had been implementing the reports of the participants of the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPPS), Kuru, near Jos, Plateau state. Gov. Wike stated that the implementation of the reports of studies conducted by the national institute would help governments at all levels address key developmental challenges. He spoke during a courtesy visit by participants of the NIPPS Senior Executive Course 41 to the Government House, Port Harcourt on Monday. “What has happened to past reports of the national institute? Gradually, this has become a national ritual. If people sit down, conduct researches and write reports based on the researches, what is the government doing with the reports? If we made use of the reports, probably, we may not be where we are today,” he said. The governor called on the Nigerian Army to restrict themselves to their constitutional responsibilities of securing the country, instead of getting involved in election rigging. “In those days when people hear about the Nigerian Army, they feared and viewed them with respect. Today, the fear is gone. Instead of improving security, they are only interested in politics. “They leave their primary responsibility. You can see the level of insecurity in the country. There is no state that is free from insecurity,” the governor stated. In his remarks, NIPPS Director of Research, Prof. Habu Galadima said that the Senior Course 41 is focusing on funding universal healthcare delivery in Nigeria, saying that the study tour would examine issues and challenges facing the funding of healthcare delivery in Rivers state. Prof. Galadima said that Rivers state was one of the hubs of healthcare delivery in the country, hence it was selected as one of the states for the research.
