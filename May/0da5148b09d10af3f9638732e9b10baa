In a press release on Saturday  signed by  his Special Adviser, Public Enlightenment, Media and Communication, Mai Ibrahim Dosara , Gov. Yari  while addressing a gathering of the APC at the Government House Gusau, said the party members and its supporters in the state have done everything possible to ensure APC did not loose Zamfara state but as Allah wanted, the party lost the state.
