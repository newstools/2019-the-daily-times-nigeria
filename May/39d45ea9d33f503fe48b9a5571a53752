Doosuur Iwambe An Ilorin Magistrate court in Ilorin, the Kwara state capital on Tuesday ordered the arrest of Commissioner of Commence and Cooperatives, Deacon Tunde Agboola. The courtâ€™s order was borne out of the failure of Agboola to appear before the court on allegations of causing bodily harm, and attempted culpable homicide on a broadcast journalist in the state. The broadcast journalist, Alhaji Abdullahi Adisa-Akodudu, was on March 28 reportedly attacked and beaten to coma by suspected hoodlums over a land dispute in llorin metropolis. The incident, it was gathered, occurred at the lrewolede Housing Estate, along Yidi road in llorin. The suspected hoodlums were said to have then demolished two structures on the disputed land. Adisa-Akodudu, who was the chairman of House Owners Association of the estate for over 13 years, is said to be the rightful owner of the land. The journalist was later found in a pool of his blood after sustaining several injuries on his head and leg. Speaking with reporters in Ilorin, counsel to the plaintiff, Yahaya Abdulrasheed Alajo, said that it was the first time that the case came up in court for mentioning.
