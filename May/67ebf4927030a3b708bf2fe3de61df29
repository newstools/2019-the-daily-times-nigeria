The Senator Ajayi Boroffice, representing Ondo North Senatorial District has frowned at the early jostling for the governorship ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo state. Sen. Boroffice made this known in a press statement made available by his media spokesman, Mr. Kayode Fakuyi on Thursday in Akure. The senator said that the party stakeholders in the state ought to address factors that were responsible for the party’s poor performance in the February presidential election and be united. “Having had an unimpressive outing in the 2019 general elections, this is the time for all leaders, stakeholders and party members to unite for genuine reconciliation and re-energize our party in Ondo state. “It is too early to be fighting and causing unnecessary noise as to who becomes our party’s candidate come the 2020 governorship election,” the statement read and refuted claims that Boroffice had endorsed and thrown his support behind a particular governorship aspirant. “In addition, we are aware some governorship aspirants have been making frantic efforts to woo and lobby prominent leaders in the political structure of Sen. Boroffice to support their governorship aspirations under the premise that he has said he has no governorship ambition. “Therefore, it is true that Sen. Boroffice has no intention to vie for the APC governorship ticket in 2020, it is untrue that he has endorsed any governorship aspirant. Hence, he has no preferred aspirant,” the statement added. The senator urged his supporters to keep faith with the party and the process of revitalizing it in the state, asserting that “they should continue to exercise patience until such an appropriate time that we will all sit together to take a collective decision on the next governorship election in Ondo state.”
