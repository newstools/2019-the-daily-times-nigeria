Chukwuemeke Iwelunmo The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) will soon  start the rehabilitation of the old Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA) following the movement of all flights emanating from the terminal to the newly constructed and commissioned CCECC terminal. FAAN yesterday, announced that it has stopped international operations from the old terminal with British Airways ending the relocation from the old to the new terminal. Thirteen (13) Airlines including, ASKY, Ethiopian Airlines, Turkish Airways, RwandAir, Emirates, Air France, Air Peace, Lufthansa, African World Airlines and Air Cote d’Ivoire have been relocating since the 6th of January, 2019 with British Airways sealing flights to the old terminal. FAAN in a brief statement signed by Mrs Henrietta Yakubu announced,” Management is pleased to announce the arrival of British Airways to the new Abuja International airport terminal today, April 30, 2019. “Management wishes to inform passengers, airport users and the general public, to note that, this historic movement marks the end of international flight operations at the old terminal of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Meanwhile, with this relocation, it is assumed that works on the old terminal will fully take effect to bring it to standard for domestic operations. Managing Director of FAAN, Engineer Saleh Dunoma said as much during the commissioning of the Port Harcourt International Airport Terminal on October 26, 2018, where he said domestic operations will move there. Same might happen at the Abuja Airport, with the relocation fully done, however, it is not a slam dunk as Northern Regional Manager, and Abuja Airport Manager, Alhaji Sani Mahmoud that government would renovate the terminal and afterwards issue a policy statement on it.
