Apart from anything else, it’s worth noting how lucky it was that Celine didn’t turn up carrying a tent. But once she had established she didn’t need to bring a sleeping bag, Celine enlisted fashion house Oscar de la Renta for a dress that took 3,000 hours to create. The result was a champagne-coloured bodysuit, embellished with silvery sequins and a hat made of gold-tinted singed peacock feathers. The part that caught the most attention, however, was her sleeves, draped in 3,000 strands of floor-length fringe, made from micro-cut glass bugle beads. Unfortunately it didn’t have quite the desired effect with everyone, as many fans compared it to a pasta drying rack. For celebrities, the annual Met Gala is a chance to show the world how famous, fashionable and flamboyant you are. The Met Gala is held every May in New York to celebrate the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s latest exhibition, with guests asked to dress to match the theme. This year’s exhibition is Camp: Notes on Fashion, and guests were encouraged to be as theatrical and colourful as possible. “The hallmark of camp is the spirit of extravagance. Camp is a woman walking around in a dress made of three million feathers,” US philosopher Susan Sontag wrote in her 1964 essay Notes On Camp. “Camp is esoteric – something of a private code, a badge of identity even, among small urban cliques.”
