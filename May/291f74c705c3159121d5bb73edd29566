A community leader and Rector, School of Management Technology, Delta state, Prof. Boniface Odeh, spoke during a courtesy visit by leaders of Oju/Obi Local Government Areas of Benue state to the Special Adviser to the President, Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The leaders commended the administration’s commitment to improving security and economic development, degrading Boko Haram and confronting corruption head long. ‘‘We align with President Buhari in all efforts to make Nigeria great again, especially in his Next Level mantra that will take us and place us on the path of greatness,’’ Prof. Odeh said. Congratulating the President on his resounding victory in the February 23 presidential election, the community leader called on the President to keep his promise of running an inclusive government in the new administration. ‘‘We have confidence and great convictions in our hearts that it is only this administration that can address the imbalances and marginalization in the areas of federal appointments, other federal presence and absence of good road networks in the thickly populated Oju/Obi Local Government Area of Benue state,’’ he said. Responding, Adesina promised to pass their demands to the President and asked them to convey the President’s appreciation to the people of Benue state for their unflinching support. ‘‘A lot of people thought Benue was a no-go-area for the President during the presidential election, but the President had a good outing in the state. I know the President will remember Benue when it comes to reward,’’ Adesina said.
