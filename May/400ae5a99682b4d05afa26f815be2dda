Tunde Opalana, Abuja The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has celebrated Mr. Kaycee Madu, a Nigerian who has been appointed Canadian minister for municipal affairs. Madu was first elected as a member of parliament in Alberta, Canada. The former vice president said seeing Nigerians prosper locally and around the world has always been the cornerstone of his vision, called the Atiku Plan. Atiku stressed that upward mobility and local and international successes of the type displayed by Mr. Madu, go a long way in changing the international narrative of Nigeria which in recent years has suffered some challenges. This was as he appreciated the role education played in preparing Mr. Madu for the spotlight. “As I have said previously, education is the single investment that yields the biggest dividend. I should know, I have put my money where my mouth is. The more Nigeria invests in education, the more our people will become beacons of light, both locally and internationally. ” Today, I celebrate Mr. Madu’s achievements. I am proud of you and will do all within my power to ensure that many Ahmadus, Gbengas and Emekas follow in your footsteps,” Atiku said.
