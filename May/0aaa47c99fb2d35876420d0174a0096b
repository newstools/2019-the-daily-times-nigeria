By Amaka Agbu, Port Harcourt Rivers state Governor, Nyesom Wike, has assented to four key bills passed by the state House of Assembly. The bills signed into law by the state governor are the Rivers state Multi-Door Courthouse Law, Rivers state Arbitration Law, Rivers state Pension Reform Law and Rivers state College of Health Sciences and Management Technology Law. Gov. Wike said that the state Pension reform law would help in resolving the challenges generated by the contributory pension scheme. He said that the state government was committed to ensuring that civil servants and pensioners were catered for, with the challenges they face completely addressed. The governor said that the arbitration law would help in the resolution of several legal conflicts without resorting to litigation, disclosing that  he was likely to seek an amendment  to the Rivers state College of Health Sciences and Management Technology Law because some stakeholders have raised concerns. He commended the state House of Assembly for their commitment to the development of the state, adding that “if you are given the privilege to serve, put in your best for the people. These four years given to us, we will do more for our people. “I urge the House of Assembly to continue to make laws for the development of Rivers state.”
