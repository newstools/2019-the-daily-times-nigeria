Activities in the once booming Palace of the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, have reduced to the lowest ebb following the creation of four additional Emirates of Bichi, Rano, Karaye and Gaya by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. The Palace was agog last Sunday when the Emir returned from Lesser Hajj with thousands of supporters welcoming him at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA). They followed his long convoy, which moved straight to the Palace from Kano airport, chanting Sarki Mai Martaba, which means, long live His Royal Highness. When our reporter visited the Palace on Tuesday morning, the atmosphere appeared gloomy. The usual hustling and bustling of visitors and huge human and vehicular traffic was no longer there. Only very few workers in the Palace were seen discussing the latest development in the Kano Emirate with hush tones.
