Governor Umaru Al-Makura of Nasarawa state has condemned the latest attacks at three communities in the state. The attacked communities are Panda in Karu, Igah in Nassarawa-Eggon and Andaha in the Akwanga Local Government Area of the state. Al-Makura made the condemnation on Friday in Lafia at the installation of retired Justice Sidi Bage-Abubakar I as the 17th Emir of Lafia. According to the governor, the government has directed heads of security agencies in the state to fish out the perpetrators of the attacks. “The perpetrators of these attacks cannot go unpunished. The government will do everything possible to ensure that we bring them to book. The perpetrators will not escape justice no matter how highly placed. “The government is committed to ensuring peace. Therefore, we cannot allow anybody to sabotage our efforts,” he vowed. The governor said further that the government had deployed security operatives to the troubled areas to forestall a further breakdown of law and order. The attacks in the three communities led to the loss of many lives with property worth millions of naira destroyed from March to this month.
