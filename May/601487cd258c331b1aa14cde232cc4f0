The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says it has concluded arrangements for the presentation of awards to five tertiary institutions at its maiden edition of the 2018 National Tertiary Admissions Performance Merit Award (NATAP-M). According to Benjamin, the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, would be doing the presentation on Thursday in Abuja. The JAMB’s spokesman noted that the award was in recognition of the institutions’ compliance to admission guidelines. “We want to honour these institutions for doing what is expected of them in the past years, in terms of admission performance. “Again, we looked at the most subscribed, the number of foreigners admitted, gender balancing and national spread. “You know some tertiary institutions will like to localise their admission by narrowing it down to candidates from their locality,” Benjamin told NAN. “All such practice does not give our institutions the deserved exposure and competition as obtained in institutions in other climes.
