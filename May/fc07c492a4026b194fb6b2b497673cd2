Samuel Luka, Bauchi Organized labour in Bauchi state has called on the state government to pay April salaries to enable workers meet various needs of their families especially during the Ramadan fasting season, Chairman of the state chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Danjuma Saleh, who addressed journalists, said that the union has rejected part payment of workers’ salaries as proposed by the state government. He disclosed that “yesterday, we were invited for a meeting with the government and our hopes were that at last, we will have negotiations on the new minimum wage, but we were shocked to our bones when we were told that they cannot pay full salaries for the month of April.” Flanked by the Chairman of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) in the state, Saleh added that “we have been waiting for that salary since the 25th of last month, only to be told that we should choose between segmental or percentage payments. We reject every form of part payment. Workers should be paid in full because they worked hard throughout the month.” The labour chairman also lamented that life without salaries during Ramadan is more difficult because workers would have less strength to look for alternative means of survival.
