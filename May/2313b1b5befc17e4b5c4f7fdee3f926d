A Federal High Court in Lagos on Friday further adjourned until May 23 to re-open hearing in a suit by Sen. Buruji Kashamu seeking to stop his extradition to the US to face alleged drug related charges. Sen. Kashamu had in his suit labelled FHC/L/CS/930/2018 joined the following the inspector-general of police, Lagos state commissioner of police, director general Department of State Services (DSS), National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and the attorney general of the federation as respondents. In the suit, he is urging the court to restrain the respondents and their agents from arresting or detaining him in any manner whatsoever or interfering with his right to personal liberty and freedom of movement. Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke had taken arguments in the suit from the respective parties and had reserved his judgment until April 29. However, on the said date, judgment could not be delivered as the period fell within the Easter vacation. The matter was consequently, adjourned until May 10. When the case was called on Friday, Ichakpa Oigoga was the only counsel who appeared on the side of the defence and he announced appearance for the NDLEA. The court then asked him if he was aware of a letter written by the applicant and when he replied in the negative, Justice Aneke asked the registrar to show him a copy of the letter. After reading the letter, Oigoga informed the court that the defence would file its counter affidavit in opposing the reliefs sought in the letter. The judge said that since a letter had already been written, the court has a duty to hear every party and consequently, adjourned the case until May 23 for hearing.
