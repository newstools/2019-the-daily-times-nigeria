Mutiat Alli, Lagos Award-winning Afro-pop sensation Yemi Alade gets in bed with American rapper Rick Ross for the remix of her sultry classic “Oh My Gosh”. The steamy DJ Coublon produced number sees Miss Alade gush uncontrollably over her “true lova”, megastar Rick Ross, who takes the track to a new hip-hop realm. The video opens with Yemi announcing herself as the only object of her new love’s affection. Draped in African splendor she is joined by a legion of beautiful dancers who celebrate her new man. And despite the fact Yemi has “many toasters” admiring her, it’s Rick who “caught a flight and jumped off the jet” to make the ultimate toast to his new-found love with glasses of the music industry’s favourite tipples, Belaire sparkling wine and Bumbu rum. Sure to be on summer pool party playlists all around the world, the track is a fun up-beat song with rhythmic African drums that got Rick and Yemi dancing. Reflecting on the electric chemistry behind the scenes, Yemi spoke about working with Rick in an episode for “The Bumbu Room”, Bumbu’s wildly popular Q&A series.
