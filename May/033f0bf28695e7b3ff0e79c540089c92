Isaac Job, Uyo Akwa Ibom state Governor, Udom Emmanuel has petitioned against the Port- Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHEDC) to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) for hoarding electricity generated by the Ibom power plant to residents in the state. The petition was the state government’s reaction to an avalanche of complaints by residents in the state against the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHEDC) for the frequent power outages and the exorbitant monthly estimated bills from the power distribution firm. In his petition to the electricity regulatory commission made available to newsmen in Uyo yesterday, Gov. Udom said that “there is sufficient power generation from the state owned Ibom power plant to provide steady and quality electricity to the entire state, but PHEDC has refused to pick the load.” In execution of its quasi- judicial functions, Section 46 of the Electric Power Sector Reform (EPSR) Act 2005 empowers NERC to conduct hearings following the receipt of petitions from aggrieved persons in accordance with Rule 14 of NERC Business Rules 2006 and based on this, the NERC has invited PHEDC for a hearing. Commenting on the governor’s petition, the Special Assistant to the governor on Power, Mennyene Etukudo said the state government is worried about the huge investment it has made in power generation, yet power supply in the state remains very poor. Etokudo, who is also the managing director of Ibom Power Company said Gov. Udom is not happy at the way the state is being treated by the PHEDC in the power distribution chain. The governor’s aide however, explained that Akwa Ibom would soon take delivery of 38, 000 units of prepaid electricity meters from the PHEDC for distribution to residents in the state. He said the gesture was informed by the need to respond to demands of residents for prepaid meters  in the state in line with NERC directives against use of the estimated billing system.
