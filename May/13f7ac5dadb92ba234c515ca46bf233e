Also, the All-Share Index which opened at 29,212.00 lost 15.13 points or 0.05 per cent to close at 29,196.87. The performance was influenced by price depreciation in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are, Mobil Nigeria, Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN), Guaranty Trust Bank, UACN Property and Ikeja Hotel. Analysts at United Capital Limited noted that “Looking ahead, we expect activities in the local bourse to remain tepid in absence of positive triggers that could spur massive buying interest. “However, we do not rule out the possibility of intermittent gains in the market on the backdrop of bargain hunting of stocks with relatively cheap prices.” NEM Insurance recorded the highest price gain of 9.95 per cent, to close at N2.43 per share.
