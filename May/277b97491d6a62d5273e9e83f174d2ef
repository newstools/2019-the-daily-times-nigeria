By Samuel Luka, Bauchi Bauchi state Governor -elect, Sen. Bala Mohammed has appealed to incumbent Governor Abubakar to direct the immediate payment of workers’ salaries to enable the ‎people commence fasting with ease, especially as funds from the federation account have been received by the state government. The appeal was contained in a congratulatory message to the Muslim Ummah on the beginning of this year’s fasting season in the state signed and circulated to journalists by the Spokesman to Governor- elect, Dr. Ladan Salihu yesterday. In the statement, Bala said that “this year’s Ramadan is coming after a period of intense and trying campaigns and elections in which raw nerves were put to test and political differences have in some instances set our people apart.” The governor-elect added that “it is imperative for all of us to embrace peace and forge ahead with a collective will to make Bauchi state a shining example to all.” Sen. Bala expressed hope that the people of the state will use the Ramadan period to show sacrifice, self-restraint while praying for divine intervention so that Bauchi state will rise and shine again. He urged Muslim faithful to love their neighbours and extend a helping hand to the weak and needy, adding that “we must continue to pray and work for peace in our state as we begin a countdown to a seamless, hitch-free transition on May 29.”
