The Speaker, Jigawa state House of Assembly, Alhaji Isa Idris (APC/Gwaram) has been impeached and replaced by a former Speaker of the assembly, Alhaji Idris Garba (APC/Gumel) on Thursday in Dutse. The impeachment of the deposed speaker at plenary was presided by Speaker pro-tempo, Mr. Hamza Bala (APC/Kazure), following his nomination by the Clerk of the House, Malam Hamisu Attahir. Other principal officers removed along with the speaker are the Chief Whip and the Majority Leader of the assembly, Aminu Sale and Sani Isyaku, respectively. They were replaced with Kayes Abdallah (APC/Malammadori) as chief Wwip and Bala Hamza (APC/Kazaure) as majority leader. The re-elected speaker was impeached in January 2017 by 25 out of the 30 members of the House. The legislators had impeached Garba due to alleged high handedness and abuse of power. In his acceptance speech, the new speaker promised to carry all his colleagues along in the discharge of his duty and therefore, sought for support and cooperation of all the members. Answering a question on the impeachment, the new speaker replied “democracy took its course. My dear colleagues, I just want to be brief. This is so wonderful and this is also a remarkable day which I will never forget in my life. This is the second time I am being sworn in as the Speaker of this Honourable House. “In 2015, I saw some signs that I would be elected as the speaker, but today, I never expected that to happen. Therefore, I want to use this opportunity to extend my appreciation for the confidence you reposed in me. “I want to assure that I will never let you down. You know my capabilities and I think that is why you brought me back. So even though we have few weeks to go, I assure that we will do everything possible to settle our pending issues in this honourable house,’’ the new speaker said.
