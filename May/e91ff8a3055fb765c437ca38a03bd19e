Samuel Luka, Bauchi Governor Mohammed Abubakar has charged the police and other security agencies to intensify intelligence gathering in order to suppress the criminal elements that are trying to tarnish the good name of the state. The governor gave this charge while receiving the newly posted Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Habu Ahmadu in Bauchi. A press release signed by the Press Secretary to the governor, Abubakar Al-Sadique quoted the governor as giving the security agencies matching orders to “intensify intelligence-based security strategy that has kept Bauchi state safe in the past four years to address the challenge of youth banditry. “I want you to be on the lookout for those engaged in Sara-suka as we have sworn to secure our people and their property. We must do everything to eliminate them.” Gov. Abubakar, who noted that most forests in northern Nigeria have been turned to save haven for criminal elements, explained that it takes the combination of government’s political will and provision of logistics, vigilance of security agencies and community policing to make Bauchi the safest in the North East zone. Earlier, the Police Commissioner, Alhaji Habu Ahmadu, who commended the governor for his support to the police in executing their policing mandate, said the police in the state is reviewing their strategies with a view to drawing an action plan that will serve as performance assessment module. The commissioner said his major task in the state is to achieve evidence-based policing that will have full respect for human rights. He therefore, sought government’s support to properly police the state in order to attract investors and contribute to the successful execution of oil exploration activities in the state.
