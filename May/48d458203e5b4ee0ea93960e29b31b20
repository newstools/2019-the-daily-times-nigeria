…says Nigeria under Buhari has defeated ethnic and religious bigotry The Coalition for Good Governance and Change Initiative, a civil society organization, on Monday staged a ‘thank you’ rally in appreciation to President Muhammadu Buhari for reappointing Godwin Emefiele as the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Governor for another term. The group led by Coalition for Good Governance and Change Initiative and the crowd in their thousands in an open letter addressed to the president, commended him for defeating what it tagged ‘ethnic and religious bigotry’ with Emefiele’s reappointment. Comrade Okpokwu Ogenyi, National Coordinator/Convener in the letter noted that security and the economy were too sensitive to consider ethnic or religious coloration and Mr. President has proven that these two sectors were very dear to his heart, hence, his reappointment of Emefiele. The group, therefore, called on other Nigerians to rally round the president as he strives to boost the nation’s economy and as well make Nigeria a terror-free nation.
