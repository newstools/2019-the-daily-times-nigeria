Tom Okpe, Abuja The head of Catholic Church in Sri-Lanka has rejected a gift of bullet proof car from its government after the Easter Sunday bombing on churches and hotels in the countrythat caused many death and lots with different degrees of injury. Cardinal Malcom Ranjith told newsmen in the country on Tuesday, monitored by our correspondent that; “A bullet proof car was sent for my use, but I have rejected it; the security of the public is more important than my security”. The Cardinal played a key role in preventing a possible backlash against Muslims in the country appealing for calm after the bombing which mainly claims the lives of Catholics at churches, went ahead to condemn those responsible for the dastardly act. A cabinet Minister on Tuesday said that the government had offered additional security to the leaders of the catholic church as they believe that they are under threat from Islamist militants saying it was the government’s duty to offer security even if it was rejected. The Minister Rajitha Senaratne said: “Our intelligence reports say that the leaders of the Catholic Church are under threat in view of the massacre in the Mosque in New Zealand recently”. It was claimed that the bombings were intended to retaliate for the March attack against Muslims in two Mosques in the New Zealand city of Chrischurch. Security around places of worship has been stepped up as part of increased security measures after the multiple bombings in the city with armed forces backed by the police, continuing to search operations in various parts of the country, leading to more arrests and more detentions including vehicles that were used to transport explosives.
