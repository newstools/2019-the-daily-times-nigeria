The Kwara North Elders’ Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday called on the Governor –elect, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq to ensure fair and equitable distribution of political appointments in the state. The elders in a communique jointly signed by the Chairman of the council and Secretary, Abubakar Mora and Manzuma Abdulmalik respectively in Abuja, said the approach would guarantee unity and strengthen the party in the state. The group advised that Kwara North should get the ministerial slot, secretary to the state government, membership of APC national executive committee and speakership of the state House of Assembly. They condemned some self-serving leaders for misplacing priorities of the area, adding that the plight of the zone would no longer be taken with levity. The zone according to the group, gave an average of 82 per cent of total votes from the area in the just concluded general elections. The council said further that the region was not in contest with anybody or group of persons either within or outside the senatorial district, even as the elders’ council also emphasized that equity and fair play in the sharing of political offices remains key in building an all-inclusive government which the governor- elect is championing. According to the group, getting the highly coveted ministerial slot and secretary to the state government position would ensure inclusiveness of the zone in the politics of the state.
