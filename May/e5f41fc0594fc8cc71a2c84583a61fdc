By Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja Barely few days after the 2019 UTME results were released, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has noted that over 1.3 million candidates have been able to access their results. JAMB’s Head, Media and Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin stated this during an interview with journalists in Abuja on Wednesday. Reacting to the reports making rounds that majority of candidates are yet to access their results, he dismissed the report as false and misleading, adding that “I want to refute all these claims as there is no truth in them. “First and foremost, by our records, over 1.3 million candidates who sat for this examination have accessed their results using the code for checking the results, which remains 55019. “Again, let me also state in clear terms that the N50 charged in the process of checking these results does not go to JAMB, but to the various service providers.” He stated that the body had to react because of the rumours that the board is charging a fee for checking of results. Benjamin while giving the breakdown of the total number of results checked through the various network providers, noted that MTN had the highest with a total of 888, 598, followed by Glo, with a total of 190, 923. According to him, Airtel had some technical hitches, but the challenges have been addressed, adding that a total of 62, 170 candidates had also accessed their results using the 9mobile service provider. The spokesman expressed the board’s sincere apologies over the development and appreciated the candidates for their concern in accessing their results.
