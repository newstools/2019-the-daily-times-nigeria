The senator who represents Benue North West, said this while fielding questions from newsmen on Monday at Benue Hotels, Makurdi. He stated that Akume still remains his leader even though they may have differences in political ideology, but that the most important thing is for them to synergize for the benefit of the people of the senatorial district. According to him, he was expecting victory at the election petition tribunal as was delivered, but in order not to give anything to chance, he decided to assembly lawyers to stand for him to challenge the case filed by Akume and the APC. Distancing himself from speculations that he was planning alongside Senator Gabriel Suswam to defect to the ruling APC, Sen. Jev said the speculation was meant to generate bad blood between him and his party, the PDP and called on his supporters to disregard such hate news milling round.

Sen. Jev further disclosed that the River Buruku bridge remains one of the projects he would continue to lobby the executive arm of government to construct as it will boost the economic potentials of the people.
