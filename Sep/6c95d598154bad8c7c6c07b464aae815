The Lagos state government says it will establish a one-stop shop for film makers in the state. This is part of efforts to boost the film and entertainment industry, to ensure film makers enjoy support from conceptualisation of ideas to the final production. Lagos state Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mrs. Shuli Adebolu, gave this indication at the graduation ceremony of the Pioneer MultiChoice Talent Factory Scholars drawn from across West Africa, held at the Lagos Business School in Ajah area of Lagos. Mrs. Adebolu explained that the state is blessed with beautiful locations for film production and efforts are been considered to ensure the state has a one-stop centre that would ensure quality and timely  production of films that meet domestic and international standards, which would grow the industry and also attract foreign investors. The commissioner equally reiterated the commitment of the present administration in the state to the tourism and entertainment sector by ensuring that the state becomes the preferred destination for tourists and the entertainment hub of the continent. “Lagos is the second largest in the amount of films produced on the continent globally. The state is therefore, set to open her doors by creating an enabling environment, regulation and solid foundation that would make the sector a flourishing one that can successfully rival the likes of Hollywood and Bollywood,” she said. While commending MultiChoice for its talent factory initiative, she restated the readiness of the state government to collaborate with the private sector and key stakeholders for the development of the industry to create jobs and source of revenue for the state.
