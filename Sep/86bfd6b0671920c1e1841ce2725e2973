The Department of State Service  (DSS) on Friday refused a bailiff of the Federal High Court in Abuja from servicing a new court order for the release of Mr. Omoye Sowore. The bailiff who was at the DSS headquarters in Abuja at about 9.30 a.m. today was refused entry into the DSS the headquarters because the Director-General of DSS, Yusuf Bichi was not in the office. The bailiff returned to the DSS headquarters at 12.14 p.m. on Friday yet was denied entry. Even if Sowore is released they have made their point – FFK One of Sowore’s lawyer, Sam Ogala, who was at the main gate of the DSS office during the bailiff’s attempt to serve the security agency, confirmed the development. The Federal High Court in Lagos on Tuesday had ordered the immediate release of Sowore from the custody of the Department of State Service, DSS. Justice Taiwo Taiwo said the activist should be released to his lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), who is to produce him for arraignment whenever he is required. Falana had told the court that since the detention order has expired and application for renewal has been withdrawn, the court should make a consequential order and release Sowore.“If the court wants him and i will produce him (Sowore).” Falana said that the DSS was illegal and not the creation of National Security Act. That it was SSS that was written in that section but the prosecution argued that it was the same but just a semantics. Falana referred the court to the case of MKO Abiola 1995 vs FG where the appellant was charged with treasonable felony and the court granted him bail even on self recognition. Falana said he was also charged with treasonable felony and Justice Taiwo Taiwo was the one who defended him and he was granted bail.
