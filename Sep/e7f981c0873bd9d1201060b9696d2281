…Cautions against tampering of evidence The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has raised alarm over what it described as undue delay by the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal to release the record of its judgment to enable the party and its Presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, to promptly file an appeal to upturn the judgment at the Supreme Court. The party said it  believe that the delay is a calculated attempt by some quarters to frustrate its appeal at the Supreme Court, where Nigerians have expressed confidence to get justice as well as restore the integrity of the  judiciary, which has been eroded by the tribunal. “It is instructive to state that the Court of Appeal is aware that our party and candidate have mandatory 14 days to appeal to the Supreme Court, yet it is delaying in releasing a judgment that was read for nine hours and which it wants the public to believe it actually wrote. “Our party fears that this development is lending credence to suspicion
in the public space that the judgment is being tampered with and altered, in the name of correcting errors, knowing that there is no way the verdicts can stand the scrutiny of the Supreme Court. “We also hope there is no link between the circumstances surrounding this
delay and the boasts by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji
Lai Mohammed, speaking for the Buhari Presidency, as well as the
National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams
Oshiomhole, that justice will not be served to the PDP and our
Presidential candidate at the Supreme Court. “The PDP had always alerted Nigerians of the relentless efforts by the APC to manipulate processes and we are happy that our party and Nigerians in general, have the full video and audio recording of the judgment and we will not hesitate to expose any underhand act by anybody”, said the party in a statement on Friday by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan. The PDP  therefore, demanded the immediate release of the record of judgment as delivered by the tribunal without any form of alterations.
