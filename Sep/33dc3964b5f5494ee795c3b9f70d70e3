Jennifer Lopez and pop star Shakira have announced that they would headline the National Football League’s Super Bowl halftime show in Miami in February 2020. The 50-year-old Lopez announced this on her twitter handle on Thursday while applauding the success of her much-lauded performance in the recently released film “Hustlers.” Lopez, tweeted photo of her and Shakira, with a caption with emojis that explained that they were going to “set the world on fire.” Shakira, who also confirmed this in a tweet, said, “It
doesn’t get any bigger than this! So excited about getting on that
#SuperBowlLIV.” The NFL also confirmed the news on Twitter, saying that the
Latina superstars will be part of the NFL’s bid to rebuild its embattled
halftime show , one of pop music’s most visible gigs, which last year struggled
to secure performers over the treatment of former San Francisco 49ers
quarterback Colin Kaepernick. The 2019 halftime show saw the performance slot go from
highly coveted to largely unwanted, with prominent artists including Rihanna,
P!nk and Cardi B reportedly turning it down over Kaepernick’s plight.
