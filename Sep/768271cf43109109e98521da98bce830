Israel said on Monday that an Iranian-backed force had fired several rockets from Syria at northern Israel, but the projectiles failed to reach Israeli territory. A military spokesperson said in a statement that a number of rockets were launched from Syria towards Israel, but all of them fell short before hitting Israel. “The rockets were launched from the outskirts of Damascus by Shiite militia operatives operating under the Iranian Quds Force, referring to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ arm.’’ The military sent a warning to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, saying that the army holds the Syrian regime responsible for all events taking place in Syria. The fire came amidst heightened tensions in the region. Between Sunday and Monday, Israel allegedly carried out airstrikes in eastern Syria, targeting Iranian-backed forces and killing 18 fighters, according to local media. Israel has carried out hundreds of deadly airstrikes in Syria, charging the attacks targeted weapons convoys to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, and Iranian sites. (Xinhua/NAN)
