The General Public AND ALL PROSPECTIVE CORPS MEMBERS are hereby notified that NYSC Portal would be opened on Monday 14th October 2019 for 2019 Batch “C’ SERVICE YEAR REGISTRATION. Accordingly, all NIGERIAN FOREIGN TRAINED GRADUATES should register and upload all the required academic, professional credentials (where APPLICABLE) and travel documents.
