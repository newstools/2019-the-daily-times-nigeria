Cristiano Ronaldo, now has a mobile game to his name, thanks to North Korea who launched a new mobile game that features the Portuguese football legend. State media have boasted that King of Scoring 2019 is
enjoying popularity across the country, as it features many big stars in
European football still active on the pitch. The game allows users to learn and practice different
football skills, and judging by images from the game, they can do so by
selecting to play Ronaldo himself. Screenshots published on the Arirang-Meari website suggest
