Mr. Omoyele Sowore, convener of #RevolutionNow protest has arrived the Federal High Court in Abuja set for his arraignment on charges of treasonable felony and other sundry offences instituted against him by the Federal Government. The Punch reports that Sowore, who was surrounded by operatives of the Department of State Services for the scheduled arraignment, arrived the fourth floor of the court edifice at about 9.10am chanting ‘Revolution,’ with his waiting followers completing the slogan with a chorus of “Now.” He is to be arraigned before Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, whose courtroom is located on the fourth floor. Recall that on September 24, upon a request by Sowore’s legal team led by Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), Justice Taiwo Taiwo granted him bail, with the sole condition that he deposit his passport in the court’s registry. But one week after meeting the bail condition, the DSS has yet to release the activist. However, the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunnaya, told The PUNCH  that the agency had yet to be served with the court order for Sowore’s release. Debunking the DSS’ claim in a swift reaction, Falana said Ayuba Adam of the Legal Department of the DSS received the court order on behalf of the agency on September 24, 2019 (Tuesday), adding that the agency’s lawyer, G. O. Agbadua, represented the agency in court on the day the order was issued. On Friday, the DSS operatives blocked a bailiff of the court from serving the court order again on the agency.
