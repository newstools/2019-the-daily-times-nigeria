Prince Abiodun said: “I call on Nigerians to support the present administration with prayers and work with President Buhari to end insurgency and other fault-lines that divide us as one indivisible and united country. “I pray that the country would witness prosperity, peace and progress.

I am confident that with his efforts, by the time we celebrate our 60th Independent Anniversary, we shall be full of greater joy and fulfilment.” The governor also restated his administration’s commitment towards ensuring good governance by being just, equitable and fair in the distribution of the dividends of democracy across the state.
