Wife of the Akwa Ibom state Governor, Mrs. Martha Udom Emmanuel said her pet project, Family Empowerment and Youth Re-orientation Path Initiative (FEYRep) has empowered more than 3, 000 women in different areas of life in the state. Mrs. Udom disclosed this at the weekend in Uyo while briefing newsmen on the achievements recorded by FEYRep since its inauguration in September 21, 2015. “Women empowerment is one of the topmost agenda in my heart. I have empowered more than 3, 000 women since inception of FEYRep. Why I am doing this is because I realised that when a woman has something doing, the family will function very well and she will be able to take care of her children. “So, I decided to go into empowerment of women in different areas. There are some that acquired vocational skills like tailoring and hair dressing. For those in farming and trading, we give them take-off grants. “So I can say that we have recorded positive results from these empowerment programmes. Women are beginning to do something with their hands better than what used to be in the past,” she observed. Mrs. Udom said through her pet project she has also recorded tremendous achievement in the area of healthcare, adding that “we have had several interventions; so many medical outreaches in the rural areas where thousands of people that would never be able to pay for those services were catered for. “We partnered with MTN Foundation where we have thousands of people that benefitted from that programme. So many of them had eye surgery free of charge and other diseases treated. And we have taken care of all that without making noise. “So in the area of medical intervention God has used us to bless and to help the poor in the society,” she added. The governor’s wife further disclosed that the FEYRep initiative has launched separate programmes to train both boys and girls to become responsible citizens of society.
