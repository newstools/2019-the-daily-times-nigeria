Residents of Gloryland and Graceland communities at Isheri-Idimu area of Lagos have appealed to the Lagos State governor,  Babajide Sanwo-Olu to urgently call the Oba of Isheri-Olofin, HRM Oba wahab Balogun to call his son, Idiris Balogun aka “Oluomo” to order and not to cause crisis by his actions within the area. Speaking on behalf of the two communities, the chairman of Gloryland community,  Mr Okwy Ejesie explained that both Gloryland and Graceland communities were under the Federal Government site and services scheme in Isheri-Olofin, Egbe Idimu  Local Council Development Area of Lagos State. Adding that for 25 years, these two communities have never benefited from any developmental project either from the state or the Federal Government. “This ugly situation and neglect by both tiers of governments to its taxpaying citizens have continued to subject the residents of these two communities to harrowing experiences and difficulties especially, during the raining season as it often become practically difficult for residents to access their homes. The situation residents have been painfully living with in the last 25 years.
