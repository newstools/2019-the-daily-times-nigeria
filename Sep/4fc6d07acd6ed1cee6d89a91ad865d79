Tells Nigerians not to follow some “stupid people” online A post shared by  Lindaikejiblog (@lindaikejiblogofficial) on Sep 10, 2019 at 12:49am PDT Again,  his wife, Busola had also come out to debunk the news that, she demanded N10M from Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo. Busola Dakolo filed a suit in a High Court in Abuja on Monday where she demanded for a personal apology from the senior Pastor of  Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, COZA for allegedly raping her at age 18 , causing her series of emotional trauma, especially in her marital sex life. The 10M Naira compensation rumour was actually the cost of action for the process of apology not a compensation for the claimant.
