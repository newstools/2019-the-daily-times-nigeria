The Abia State governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, has on Saturday, urged Chief Uche Ogah and Dr. Alex Otti, representing the All Progressive Congress (APC) and All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) respectively, to sheathe their swords and join him in rebuilding Abia State. Ikpeazu, who was declared winner after the Tribunal ruling
on Friday, stated that he has no grudge against his opponents in the March 9
governorship election in the state, adding that the duo only exercised their
rights. Recall that Ogah and Otti had approached the election petition tribunal to upturn the results of the election but the tribunal upheld the governor’s victory and declared the petitions filed by the challengers as unmeritorious. Vanguard reports that, Ikpeazu, who spoke at the Abia State
Government House in Umuahia, commended the tribunal for the verdict and also expressed
gratitude to people of the state for giving him their mandate. He said the victory would energize him to work harder for
the good of the state. “More than ever before, we shall henceforth be
relentless in the vigorous pursuit of our developmental agenda for the people
of Abia State,” he said.
