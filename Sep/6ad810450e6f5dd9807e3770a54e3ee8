A man shot and killed his wife of 33 years and attempted to commit suicide in front of their two grandchildren a week after he took to Facebook to accuse his wife of cheating. According to the Daily Mail, Eddie Harris allegedly shot and killed his high school sweetheart, Shanica Harris, inside of their Liberty home on Saturday, September 28. Friends and family said the couple had been together since they were 15 and shared five children and multiple grandchildren. Last week, Harris shared subliminal posts about his wife possibly cheating on him. On the day of the murder, Eddie posted on Facebook that Shanica brought one of her boyfriends to their home. Miami-Dade police said in a statement that Eddie Harris had a rifle in his hand when he had a stand-off against SWAT officers. The two grandchildren, aged 6 and 9, who witnessed their grandmother’s death, were escorted out of the home by Special Response Team members. The children were unharmed. Upon entering the home, investigators found Shanica’s body and Eddie suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after his stand off with police. Eddie was transported to the Jackson Memorial Hospital Ryder Trauma Center for treatment. His condition is currently unclear. Before her death, Shanica thanked her husband for buying a new silver Mercedes Benz but complained about the color. Shanica’s sister, Thomasina Goddard, said Harris was very controlling and endangered the safety of his grandchildren. Thomasina said: He barricaded himself in the house and kept my sister at blood death, with my grandniece and grandnephew in the house. My sister was the sweetest girl you would’ve know. She worked very hard for her kids and family”
