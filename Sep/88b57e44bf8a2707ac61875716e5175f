The All Progressives Congress (APC) has  said that we are better together than we are apart as  a nation. The APC in its message on the country’s 59th Independence Anniversary by Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary said: “As a nation, we are better together than we are apart. Hence, we must be wary of those who hide under religion, politics, tribe and sundry groupings to turn us against one another. Despite our perceived differences, our strength and progress depends on our ability to harness our rich diversity. “In spite of the inherited and our current challenges, President Muhammadu Buhari administration has made commendable strides on so many fronts, most significantly the fight against graft, diversifying and revamping the economy, curbing insurgency and emerging crimes, promoting positive values in our national life, strengthening our democratic institutions and processes and achieving a respectable international standing.

The President Buhari administration is committed to building on and affirming our Giant of Africa status.”
