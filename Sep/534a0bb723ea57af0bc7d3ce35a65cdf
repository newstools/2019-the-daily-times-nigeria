petitioners failed to prove their claim of over-voting and substantial
non-compliance. Prior to this ruling, the tribunal upheld the preliminary objection of the 2nd and 3rd. respondents, PDP and Bwacha, on the grounds that the petitioners did not pay the required filing fees as at the point of presenting the petition before the tribunal’s secretary on March 14, 2019.
