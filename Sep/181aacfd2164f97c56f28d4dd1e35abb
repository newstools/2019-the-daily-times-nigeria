Former Governor of Benue state and senator representing Benue North East Senatorial District, Senator Gabriel Suswam has said that he has no plan to leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Sen. Suswam, who was reacting to news on some online platforms, described the news as fake, misleading and that the news was   planted by detractors of the senator and the PDP. In a statement signed by the Personal Assistant to the senator, Michael Zendesha, Sen. Suswam called on members of the public, especially the Benue people to disregard the news. The statement reads: “We state categorically that Senator Gabriel Suswam has no intention of leaving the PDP, where he has firm support at the national, state and across all local governments, wards and units of the party. “Media houses and members of the public should be wary of stories like this, planted by detractors of the Senator and the PDP. These persons are threatened by the wide acceptance and support which the senator enjoys from his people and colleagues at the National Assembly. “Sen Suswam’s popularity within the party and across the country is overwhelming and the few deviant propagandists and their sponsors are warned to desist from the irresponsible act of trying to spread falsehood.” Daily Times recalls that some online portals reported last week that Sen. Suswam had opened talks with some highly powerful northern politicians preparatory to the 2023 general election, saying he would be interested in joining the ruling APC.
