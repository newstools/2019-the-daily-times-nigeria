The Executive Chairman of the Plateau State Universal Basic
Education Board (SUBEB), Prof. Mathew Sule, has decried the absence of teachers
under the Federal Government’s N-power scheme, who were recruited to teach in
public primary schools in the state. Prof. Sule stated this on Monday, while monitoring resumption of schools at Obasanjo Model School, Hwolshe, compromising of Schools A, B and C in Jos South Local Government Area. The chairman who lamented on the nonchalant behavior of the teachers, stated that they will be reported to the appropriate authorities. He said, “This is morally wrong, where people are posted to
schools and they do not attend to their responsibilities, we have no choice but
to report them to the appropriate authorities.’’ “If they cannot come
to school, they should be taken to other places, we want orderliness, they must
go by the school rules and create a conducive learning environment for the
children,” he added. Vanguard reports that, Prof Sule stated that some of them
are unable to have time for the teaching scheme because of their multiple
engegements, adding that they were not justifying government resources given to
them through the project. Prof Sule, charged them to disengage from the scheme if they
could not cope with its responsibilities, saying they must justify the
allowances given to them as many unemployed persons were looking for such
opportunities. However, he commended parents for the large turnout of
pupils in the schools, saying it was evidence that they heeded to the board’s
plea for the early resumption and immediate take-off of the 2019/2020 new
school session. He urged the pupils to be punctual to school, be of good
conduct, respect their teachers and study hard to improve on their last
session’s grades. In her response, Mrs Martha Gyang, the headteacher of the
School, pledged their commitment to discharge their duties diligently and
report teachers who failed in such compliance.
