The emblem for the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar has been unveiled in Doha and 27 other major cities around the world. The design was inspired by Arab culture with the central theme based on a woollen shawl to reflect it being the first World Cup staged in the winter. The emblem was also projected in London’s Leicester Square, New York’s Time Square and Gare du Nord in Paris.
