In a move to deter illegal operators and drive compliance, the Nigerian Postal service (NIPOST) recently clamped down on operators of illegal courier services. The General Manager, Courier Regulatory Department, Andrew Ebiloma, general Manager, courier Regulatory Department, during the clamp down on the operators in Lagos said the activities of illegal services had impacted negatively on the growth of registered businesses and government revenue. According to Ebiloma, the Federal Government’s policy on the Ease of Doing Business (EODB) was for courier businesses to get their licenses and have regulatory backing for operation, adding that the sector is a major driver of the economy. Speaking on why operators need to register their firms and regularise their papers and why it is imperative for the government to continue to shut down illegal operators, Ebiloma said, “We get a report of misplaced parcels but we can’t track that delivery if it is not from a registered firm. Many people think they can do a brisk business. Those that NIPOST shut down today have been engaging in illegal operations. This is to warn others and make them regularise their papers. “Government is losing millions due to illegal operators. So, anyone caught would be made to face the full process of the law. We have valid reasons to shut down on these firms today because we have enough evidence against them.” “The license for national service is N2 million. If in a year, 50 firms decide not to get their license, that’s a huge loss to the government already.” The firms that came under the hammer  of NIPOST was, Efex Express Limited, Westwood Courier Service and Easy Errand Courier Service.
