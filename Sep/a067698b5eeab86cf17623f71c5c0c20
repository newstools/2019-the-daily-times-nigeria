I have also been humbled by the faith and belief that numerous persons have expressed in me. “My sincere interest is to see a Nigeria that grows and optimises resources for the benefits of all Nigerians. My loyalty to the good cause of our nation, Nigeria compelled me to accept the call to provide technical skills and this experience has more than strengthened it. “I also want to wish the Nigerian government led by President Muhammadu Buhari well. I will always be of help to the federal government in my capacity as the director of BudgIT, a critical fiscal transparency group, as I have been to several agencies. “I would also work to ensure that BudgIT continues to build civic awareness on the right of every Nigerian to know how public resources are managed.”
