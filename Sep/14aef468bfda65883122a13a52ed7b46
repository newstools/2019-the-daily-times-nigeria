No.4 seed Simona Halep of Romania moved into the round of 16
at the Dongfeng Motor Wuhan Open for the first time since 2016, after picking
up a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Barbora Strycova of the Czech Republic. Halep in a post-match press conference said she was
motivated to go on court and to give everything she had, to play well, to fight
for the victory. Reigning Wimbledon champion, Halep came into the match with
a spotless 5-0 head-to-head against Strycova, and she maintained that
undefeated record with her 85-minute win. Strycova, who reached her first-ever Grand Slam semifinal in
singles at Wimbledon earlier this year, has yet to win a set from Halep in
their six meetings.
