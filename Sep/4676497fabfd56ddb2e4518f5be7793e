Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has said that the works and housing sector is critical to President Muhammadu Buhari’s Next Level target of moving one million Nigerians from poverty. Fashola according to a statement signed by the Director of Press in the ministry, Mrs. Boade Akinola, stated this when members of the Good Governance Ambassadors of Nigeria (GOGAN), South West zone led by the Zonal Coordinator, Alhaja Olabisi Eletu, paid him a courtesy visit in Abuja. While describing good infrastructure as the first step to ensuring prosperity, the minister disclosed that the government is doing its possible best to address issues of abandoned projects and infrastructural deficit especially in the South West. Fashola said that GOGAN’s message of good governance is in agreement with President Muhammadu Buhari’s determination to provide good governance and quality service to Nigerians. “With good infrastructure, value of properties increase and owners earn more money. “Everything you have asked for is already happening. Government is executing road projects. Government is actually responding to our demands,” he added. The minister enjoined members of GOGAN to assist the current administration by sensitising Nigerians on the need to respect democracy and rule of law. Earlier, the Zonal Coordinator, Alhaja Eletu disclosed that the visit is aimed at congratulating the minister over his reappointment and to commend his passion, doggedness and zeal toward achieving set goals as well as counselling the minister on good governance. She maintained that the association was set up to create awareness on good governance and self-discovery among Nigerians. Eletu also announced GOGAN’s decision to make Fashola the grand patron of the body.
