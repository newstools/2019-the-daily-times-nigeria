Ukpono Ukpong – Abuja Minister of State for FCT, Dr. Ramatu Aliyu, has called on corps members serving in the territory to take advantage of government’s favourable policies to create wealth instead of seeking for white collar jobs. Aliyu, made the call in Abuja during the closing ceremony of the 2019 ‘batch B’ stream 11 orientation course. While noting that the federal government is championing poverty reduction through wealth creation, she expressed optimism that with the knowledge garnered through skills acquisition and entrepreneurship development training the corps members will not only become self-employed, but also employers of labour. She used the occasion to remind the corps members that the Federal Capital Territory is beyond Abuja metropolis, stressing that their services are needed more in the rural communities in the territory. Aliyu, assured corps members that the FCT administration will do all it can within the available resources to complement the efforts of the NYSC, in the area of corps welfare, while calling on them to be security conscious during the service year. “Let me remind you of the need to be security conscious. Always, remember that you are your own best security. Report any case of threat to life and property to NYSC management and security agents and do not go about looking for trouble by engaging in unwholesome practices,” she stated. Earlier, the FCT Coordinator of NYSC, Walida Isa, assured the FCT administration that the 2019 ‘batch B’ stream 11 corps members have been rebranded within the context of national consciousness and are prepared to be useful tools for the socio- economic development of Nigeria. She commended development partners and FCT area councils for their support, just as she pledged that the directorate will not abuse the trust.
