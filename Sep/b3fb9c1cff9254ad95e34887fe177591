Patrick Okohue A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kogi State, Otunba Gbolahan Adeyemi, has taken the former governor of the state, Clarence Olafemi to the cleaners for planning to defect to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He said the former governor’s indication on Sunday in Lokoja to defect to APC was not only destructive but was borne out of greed without recourse to PDP’s magnanimity shown to the politician in the past. While speaking with an online media in Abuja, Otunba Adeyemi said the former governor would be on his own, if he made good his vows, adding that Olafemi commands no followership in Kogi West. “Chief Clarence Olafemi is the former acting governor and former Speaker of Kogi State House of Assembly. He is so greedy that he has forgotten how PDP helped him to power. “His defection statement in Lokoja yesterday is so uncanny, but I assure you that nobody from Kogi West would follow him to APC if he decides to defect. “His son was to deputise the son of the former governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Ibrahim Idris, but as I speak with you, some of them who lost PDP primaries to Engr. Musa Wada have been reconciled by the National Working Committee of PDP. “What is his grouse? Why is Olafemi crying more than the bereaved? Alhaji Ibrahim Idris and his son have since calmed down and are joining hands with the candidate, so why is Olafemi troubling the party? “In 2015, he worked for APC out of anger, but Yahaya Bello later chased him away before rejoining the PDP. If he defects, he is doing that on his own,” the party chieftain emphasised. He added that Kogi PDP was working hard to unite their members in wrestling power from APC in the November governorship elections.
