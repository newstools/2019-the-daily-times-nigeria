Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva has been reported to the
English Football Association (FA) for posting an alleged racist tweet,
according to anti-discrimination charity kick it out. The Portuguese midfielder posted a photo believed to be City
teammate Benjamin Mendy as a child, with the caption: “Guess who?”
and an image of the mascot for Spanish chocolate brand Conguitos. Bernardo, who has been heavily criticized on social media,
later deleted the tweet and posted another saying: “Can’t even joke with a
friend these days… You guys…” Should the FA decide to take action, Bernardo could face a
fine or a ban. In July, the FA increased its punishment for discriminatory
behavior to a minimum six-game ban for first-time offenders. France’s Mendy replied to the tweet with a series of
laughing emojis and clapping hands, with the caption: “1-0 for you will
see.”
