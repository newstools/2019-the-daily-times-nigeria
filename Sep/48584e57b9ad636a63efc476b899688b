former heavy weight champion, Tyson Fury takes on Wallin on Saturday night. The annual Sin City fight held on Mexican Independence Day weekend, will see Wallin, 28, who has 20 wins from 20 fights and Fury a 1-25 bookies’ favorite. “I don’t underestimate anybody, I will respect everyone,” “I will train for a man like he has 20 knockouts in a row. The tall southpaw is always a challenge but I have never met a challenge I couldn’t defeat or a mountain I couldn’t climb – he will be no exception. “Hopefully we go for a beer afterwards.” said Fury.
