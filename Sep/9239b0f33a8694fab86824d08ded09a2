Another day, another opponent faces the new Toyota Supra on the drag strip. This drag race is probably the most exciting of all involving the Japanese coupe so far and we bet you’ll agree with us after just a few minutes. For this chase, the Supra lines up against a Volkswagen Golf R. The folks over at Cars.co.za took delivery of the latest examples of the two performance cars and gathered them at the Killarney drag strip in Cape Town, South Africa for what is described as “a good old-fashioned quarter-mile drag race head-to-head shootout.” Make no mistake – the new Supra is super fast. With a 3.0-liter turbo-charged engine sourced from the new BMW Z4, the coupe has at least 335 horsepower (250 kilowatts) on tap. In reality, the power is even higher and this basically means the car is significantly more powerful than the Golf R. After the facelift, the most powerful iteration of the current generation hatchback from Wolfsburg comes with a 2.0-liter turbo TSI motor, generating 306 hp (228 kW). The difference between the two is one liter of displacement, two cylinders, and at least 29 hp (22 kW). If there’s one thing we’ve learned about drag races it’s that more power doesn’t always mean a victory. On paper, the Supra should be quicker from 0 to 60 miles per hour (0-96 kilometres per hour) with a time of 4.1 seconds versus the Golf R’s time of 4.8 seconds. But, that’s just on paper as the Golf has proved it’s actually faster than what Volkswagen says with times of 4.4-4.5 seconds for the 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) run. That makes the gap between the two really small and even a minor imperfection from the drivers on the starting line could decide the race. That’s exactly the case here.
