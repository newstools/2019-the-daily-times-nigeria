At least one person was killed and two others injured in a blast in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu on Monday, the Police and witnesses confirmed. A police officer, who spoke to Xinhua on condition of anonymity, said the blast was a result of an improvised explosive device (IED), which was fitted at a police officer’s car that exploded, causing casualties and damages. “We can confirm the death of one person and two others injuries,’’ the officer said, adding that the blast also damaged a gas station nearby. An eye witness told Xinhua the blast was huge and caused panic among passers-by. “I was on the same road when I heard a loud sound of blast; then I saw people running in different directions,’’ Jibril Ga’al, a witness told Xinhua. The IED attack follows a series of similar cases in Mogadishu in recent weeks since the death of City Mayor, Abdirahman Osman, in a targeted suicide at his office last month. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. (Xinhua/NAN)
