The Chairman, Association of Licensed Private Security Practitioners of Nigeria ALPSPN, Plateau chapter, Chief Edinen Usoroh, has said that Nigeria currently ranks third on the world’s terrorism index. Usoroh revealed this in Jos at the opening of a one-day counter-terrorism awareness seminar, on Thursday. According to Usoro,”Nigeria remains the 3rd most terrorised nation in the world, according to the global terrorism index report of 2018. “The five most terrorised countries in the world are: Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria and Pakistan. Boko Haram remains the most active and deadliest terrorist group in Nigeria, and also a terror group in sub-Saharan Africa,” he said. The security expert added that the inability of Nigerian security agencies to completely tackle the Boko Haram menace was due to ‘insider threat’ According to him, the insider threat has jeopardised military operations, adding that such had compromised the integrity of the Nigerian military. “The moment a terrorist establishes a functional contact with an insider, that organisation becomes extremely vulnerable to an attack,” he said In addition, he said that apart from terrorism, other security challenges facing the country include; banditry, kidnapping, rape, suicide deaths, ritual killings, missing persons and cyber fraud.
