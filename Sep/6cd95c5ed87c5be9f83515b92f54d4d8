Nigerians and fans of BBNaija season four have continued to react after housemate, Tacha Akide was disqualified from the ongoing BBNaija  Peperdem. @BBNaija, you judgment was biased, ill-motivated@BBNaija, @Ebuka say #Mercy’s action was not a physical assault, but @Symply_Tacha’s reaction was a physical assault. LMAOI ask, was Mercy’s move an emotional or mental act?Be the JUDGE yourself pic.twitter.com/w75976EMGn Tacha was butted off the show on Friday night for violence and intent to harm fellow housemate. An old video where comedian Julius Agwu predicted Tacha's Predicament resurfaces #BBNaija #BBNaija2019 pic.twitter.com/PnYRVZiXxI Some fans disagree with the Tacha’s disqualification from the House while others supported it. @julyearth said ‘BBN is a scam, NA DEM!BBN is a scam, NA DEM!Biggie should have disqualified Mercy too, NA DEM!Tacha would have won but they disqualified her, NA STILL DEM!The hate on Tacha is too much, NA DEM OOO’. ‘Character is like a flat tyre. You cannot move forward unless you  change it.’ @BigBright_Guy said ‘Tacha fought with Frodd, Cindy, Elo, Diane, Mike, Omashola, Ike, Jackye, Seyi and still got away with it… But the day she fought with Mercy, she went home… Who is the pepper again??? ‘ Now that Tacha is out , I can finally watch Big brother without being scared of her odour coming out of my TV #bbnaija pic.twitter.com/6FqIm2nJPE Thank God I’m not smelling… Tacha sorry 😐 #BBNaija #BBNaija2019 pic.twitter.com/3zN56weGBi BBN is a scam, NA DEM!Biggie should have disqualified Mercy too, NA DEM!Tacha would have won but they disqualified her, NA STILL DEM!The hate on Tacha is too much, NA DEM OOO. 😂🤣Character is like a flat tyre.

The fight, which started on an unrelated issue, saw both housemates exchange abuses and call each other names while Mercy struggled to keep her cool. Why is Tacha’s eviction jubilation similar to Abacha’s death announcement?🤔🤔… T”ACHA” AB”ACHA” 🤔🤔 pic.twitter.com/UmF7ZGtGS0 For not stepping away from a volatile situation, Mercy was issues two strikes. This means that a third strike would lead to her disqualification. Meanwhile, Tacha had been issued two strikes earlier in the show, which were waived when Biggie introduced a clean slate. However, fans have noted that she has had heated issues with almost every housemate since the show began. Following the fight with Mercy, ex-housemates of past seasons including Kemen, Khloe, IFu Ennada and some fans of the show pointed out that disqualifications have been meted out in precious seasons for lesser reasons. Kemen, who was disqualified in season two, over alleged assault shared a screenshot of the BBNaija rule book showing physical assault was a ground for disqualification. Tacha’s exit from the show comes hours after Cindy Okafor’s surprise eviction. This brings the total housemate to eight with the show just ten days from ending. Someone is saying Peter PSquare is still gonna give Tacha the 60MillionIs it not Peter that Denied Jesus😏?#BBNaija pic.twitter.com/e9qXLRr3Cs #bbnaija pic.twitter.com/NDf3CulRrZ I stand with Tacha No Human deserves this Hatred….
