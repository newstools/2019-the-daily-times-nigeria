Karolina Muchova of the Czech Republic got her tournament success on Sunday as she thrashed Poland’s Magda Linette 6-1 6-1 to win the Korea Open in Seoul, her first WTA title. Meanwhile on the ATP Tour, Daniil Medvedev was victorious on home soil, defeating Croatia’s Borna Coric 6-3 6-1 to lift the St Petersburg Open in Russia. It was a third title of 2019 for the world number four and an impressive response in his first event since his epic five-set defeat by Rafael Nadal in the US Open final. At the Moselle Open in Metz, home favourite Jo-Wilfried
Tsonga won the title for a fourth time, coming out on top 6-7 7-6 6-3 over
Aljaz Bedene of Slovenia. Of Tsonga’s 18 tour titles, 10 have come in his
native France.
