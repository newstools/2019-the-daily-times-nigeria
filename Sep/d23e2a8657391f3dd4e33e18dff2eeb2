Antonio made his debut with the Patriots on Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium against the Miami Dolphins. The National Football League plans to meet Monday with Britney Taylor, who has accused New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown of rape. A person with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed the meeting to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Taylor accused Brown of rape and sexual assault in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in the Southern District of Florida. Brown has denied the allegations by his former trainer. Brown was eligible to play during Sunday’s game at Miami because he was not placed on the commissioner’s exempt list.

Players on the exempt list can’t play in games or practice with a team but are still paid. A player can be placed on the exempt list at any point
