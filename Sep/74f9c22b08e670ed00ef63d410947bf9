 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has allayed fears of post – governorship primaries crisis in Kogi and Bayelsa states just as the party assured that it is poised for a sweeping victory in the November 16 gubernatorial elections in both states. The party in a statement on Tuesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said its grassroots structures have been activated in the two states ahead of the elections. The PDP told members and supporters not to fear as reconciliatory efforts in the aftermath of the governorship primary elections in the two states are yielding immense results and further strengthening its structures and formation as one big, united and formidable family. The party further assured that it is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that all aggrieved members are appeased so that the party faces the elections as a family. It commended the understanding and spirit of sportsmanship exhibited by critical stakeholders in the two states as well as their commitment towards the success of the party at the elections. “The PDP notes that it has already galvanized all segments of the voting population across the two states, which are known strongholds of the party,” adding that no shenanigan by the violence-prone All Progressives Congress (APC) can stop it coasting to victory in the elections.
