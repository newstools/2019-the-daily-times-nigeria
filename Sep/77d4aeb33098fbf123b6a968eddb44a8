The Attorney
General Abubakar Malami who is the leader of the Nigerian legal team in London
has reacted to the UK judgment  as he
said, “I am pleased with today’s development in the court and see this as a
positive resolution that constitutes an important step in the Government’s
efforts to defend itself in a fair and just process.” “We look
forward to challenging the UK Commercial Court’s recognition of the Tribunal’s
decision in the UK Court of Appeal, uncovering P&ID’s outrageous approach
for what it is: a sham based on fraudulent and criminal activity developed to
profit from a developing country.” Recall that
the UK Commercial Court had earlier granted the Federal Government of Nigeria’s
request for leave to appeal, enabling the Government to appeal the Court’s
recognition of the UK Arbitration Tribunal in the UK Court of Appeal.
