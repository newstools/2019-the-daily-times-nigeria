According to her, “There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period,” Huffman said in a statement after her sentencing. “I would like to apologise again to my daughter, my husband, my family and the educational community for my actions. “And I especially want to apologise to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices supporting their children.” Also, parents and athletics coaches were among 50 people charged in the scheme, but none of the children were indicted. Judge Indira Talwani who presided over Huffman’s case believed she has accepted full responsibility for her actions, however saying “trying to be a good mother does not excuse” what she did.
