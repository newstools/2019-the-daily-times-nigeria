Al-Hilal Omdurman holding  Enyimba by 0-0 on Sunday afternoon in Aba, South East Nigeria, leaves the remaining two Nigerian representatives in the 2019/20 CAF Champions League (CAFCL) and Confederation Cup (CC) Enyimba hanging. The Sudanese side proved impenetrable although reduced to ten men after just twenty minutes when Hamid Nassir was shown a straight red card for lashing out at Enyimba left-back Daniel Darkwah. When Enyimba did break their wall, attackers Stanley Dimgba, Reuben Bala and Martins Usule missed gilt edge scoring chances leaving the second leg in a fortnight with all to play for. Rangers International on the other hand returned to the country on Sunday morning after losing 1-2 to AS Pelican of Gabon in their first leg, first round game in Libreville on Saturday. Rangers will host Pelican in the return leg at the Nnamdi Azikwe Stadium in Enugu in a fortnightâ€™s time.
