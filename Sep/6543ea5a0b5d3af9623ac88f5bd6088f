Arab Contractors of Egypt new signing Kufre Ebong confirmed that he fears no opposition in the Egyptian Premier League as he starts life in Pharaoh land this week. Nigerian striker Ebong left Libyan side Ahly Bengazi last week to team up with the Cairo-based team ahead of the new season in the Egyptian league scheduled to commence this weekend. Ebong, 24, a former Nigeria Under 23 star expects difficult games in his new home but said he is ready for it. “This is my first time in the Egyptian league but believe me, I have no fear,” Ebong said. “I know it may be hard for me at the start but this is my life, my job and I will do whatever it takes to achieve my goals in Egypt.” The former Warri Wolves forward also spoke on the reason he left Libya for Egypt, citing his former club’s financial difficulties. “I had to leave Ahly Benghazi because the club was hit with a financial crisis and we had to terminate my contract mutually. I have no regrets whatsoever, I am just focused on my new job here in Egypt,” added Ebong Ebong will be joining the list of Nigerian stars to have donned the Blue and White colours of Arab Contractors. The list includes former Super Eagles star John Chukwudi Utaka, Robert Akaruye and former Dolphins midfielder Stone Evbuomwan.
