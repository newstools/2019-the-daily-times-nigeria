else, and becomes the third senior player to quit the national team after the
World Cup. “It’s probably one of the hardest decisions I’ve had to
make,” he told Scottish Rugby. “I feel it’s the right time, for me as a player and a
person and us for a family, and for the Scotland team as well. “It’s never going to last forever and I’ve always been
passionate about you only ever getting a certain amount of time in the jersey
and you need to give they jersey everything you can. I’ve done that.” Both flanker John Barclay, who also had a spell as captain,
and wing Tommy Seymour have already announced their international retirement
this month as a new World Cup cycle begins.
