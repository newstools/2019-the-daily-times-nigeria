Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun state on Monday signed the 2020 budget of N119.5 billion into law, promising that the budget would be fully implemented. The governor signed the budget in his office in Osogbo shortly after it was formally presented to him by the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Mr. Timothy Owoeye. The appropriation bill was passed into law by the assembly on December 24. Oyetola, who described the size of the budget as the most realistic, said the government would stop at nothing to ensure its full implementation. He said that his administration decided to prune down the size of the budget, having realised the socio-economic realities and the limited resources available to the state. The governor, who promised to continue to do things that would make life more meaningful, worthwhile and abundant for the people of the state, assured them of better days in 2020 and beyond. He said that the state would do everything possible to bring about the desired development across all the sectors, as captured by the budget.
