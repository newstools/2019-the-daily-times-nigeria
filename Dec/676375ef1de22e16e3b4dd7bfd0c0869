Following my first and second concerts, I began to think of something outside the norm and pushing the limits, to achieve more with my dreams. Voila! God made it happen! I am grateful to God for everyone that made this dream an unforgettable reality.” Speaking to Iseoluwa, Funke Akindele-Bello said, “Despite my flair for the arts and entertainment, I studied Law because education is important. Education is power and you have to go to school. That gives you an edge in anything you want to do.”
