Harambee Stars defender Abud Omar is on the verge of joining  Dutch Eredivisie side Sparta Rotterdam in January according to reports. The player has been in the Netherlands in the past few weeks to 
negotiate a deal together with his representatives and it is believed he
 is being accessed by the club ahead of a potential signing. Sparta is currently placed eleventh on the Eredivisie log with 23 points and will be up against giants Ajax in their next tie slated for January 19, 2020. Based in the city of Rotterdam, Sparta was established in 1888 this 
making it the oldest professional team in the Netherlands. They play 
their home matches at The Castle Stadium and were promoted to the top 
flight in the 2018/19 season. Apart from Sparta, the defender is believed to be attracting interest
 from clubs in Belgium and Romania with a return to Greece also said to 
be a possibility. Abud has not been around the national team since head coach Francis Kimanzi took over due to lack of playing time after he parted ways with Romaniaâ€™s top-flight side Sepsi in July. Apart from Sepsi, Abud has featured for Cercle Brugge (Belgium), Slavia Sofia (Bulgaria), Panegialios (Greece), Tusker and Bandari FC in Kenya.
