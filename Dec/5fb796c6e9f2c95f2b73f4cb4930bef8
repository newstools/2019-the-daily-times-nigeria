The NICD stated that malaria cases in the country are expected to increase during the summer months, with higher temperatures and rainfall in transmission areas. People should take prevention medication before visiting malaria risk areas, limit outdoor activity after dark, cover up bare skin and using mosquito repellents. “All travellers returning from malaria transmission areas, including very low-risk ones, should report flu-like illness (headache, fever, chills, fatigue, muscle, and joint pain) that occurs up to three weeks after first potential exposure, in case it is malaria,” it said.
