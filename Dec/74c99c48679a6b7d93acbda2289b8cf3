I don’t blame them “I’ve got to speak to the IBF and the WBO and see who goes first. I think it sounds like it’s the IBF, but we’ll wait for confirmation of that. AJ will want to maintain the belts and if that’s the case, I think it will be Pulev, and then Usyk. “I think April or May, that’s a realistic kind of date [for Joshua’s next fight].” Hearn added that the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is in the running to host the fight: “We spoke to Spurs about hosting this fight (the rematch against Ruiz), which they were keen to do, but unfortunately the dates didn’t work out. They would be keen to do it and it would be a nice stadium to do it in London.”
