Wallace Wyatt told CNN affiliate KPRC that the argument was over the haircut given to the suspect’s 13-year-old son. “He went home, came back. They fixed the haircut for free and then that’s when the altercation occurred,” Wyatt told KPRC. “That is one of the worst ones I’ve heard,” he added, “especially with your son being here, witnessing what you’re doing.”
