Everton have sacked manager Marco Silva after Wednesday night’s humiliating defeat against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby. Silva, who joined the club in May 2018, was on borrowed time after a run of form which has seen the Toffees win just once in their last six Premier League games. The loss on Wednesday saw Everton drop into the relegation zone and that was clearly the final straw for the board at Goodison Park who have decided to dispense with Silva’s services heading into the busy festive period. Club legend Duncan Ferguson, who has been a member of the coaching staff under the last five Everton managers, will take charge of the first team for Saturday’s lunchtime visit of Chelsea.

Marcel Brands, the director of football, and Alexander Ryazantsev, the club’s CEO, were angrily gesticulating in the Directors’ Box at Anfield while fans left early as they watched Everton fall to another defeat across Stanley Park.
