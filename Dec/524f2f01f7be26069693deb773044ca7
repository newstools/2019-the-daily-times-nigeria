Craig Mawson has left Turf Moor to join Manchester United in a senior goalkeeping coaching role. Mawson leaves his position as head of goalkeeping coaching within the  Clarets’ Academy to join United where he will work with the first-team  keepers under senior goalkeeping coach Richard Hartis. “Burnley has been a big part of my life and I have built a real affinity with the club,” said the 40-year-old. “I thoroughly enjoyed my time there over all this time, and I am 
extremely grateful to Billy Mercer and all the Academy staff I have 
worked with. I can’t over-state what the club did for me. “But to have this chance to work in a senior position at a club of 
Manchester United’s standing is a fantastic opportunity and one I’m 
delighted to take.” Mawson’s move to Old Trafford ends an association with Burnley that 
goes back to the mid-1990s when he first joined the club as a player.
