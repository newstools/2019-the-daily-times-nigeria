President Muhammadu Buhari, is celebrating his birthday today and here are basic things you should note about the President of Nigeria. 1.President Muhammadu also spelled Muhammad, was born on December 17, 1942. Happy Birthday to my incorruptible GMB – Aisha Buhari 2.   Born to a fulani family in Daura, Katasina State, he is the twenty-third child of his father, Hardo Adamu, a Fulani chief, and mother Zulaihat. 3. Buhari enrolled at age 19 in the Nigerian Military Training College (NMTC) in 1962. 4.In July 1966 Lieutenant Muhammadu Buhari was one of the participants in the “July Rematch” or so called “Counter-Coup”, led by Lt-Col Murtala Muhammed, that overthrew and assassinated Nigeria’s first self-appointed military Head of State General Aguiyi Ironsi, who had assumed leadership of the Nigerian government after a failed coup attempt on 15 January 1966, which overthrew the elected parliamentary government of Nigeria (also known as first republic). 5.  From 1974 to 1975 Buhari was Acting Director of Transport and Supply at the Nigerian Army Corps of Supply and Transport Headquarters. 6.In 1971, Buhari married his first wife, Safinatu Buhari (First lady of Nigeria December 1983 – August 1985). They had five children together, four girls and one boy. In 1988, Buhari and his first wife Safinatu divorced. In December 1989, Buhari married his second and current wife Aisha Buhari (née Halilu). They also had five children together, a boy and four girls. 7.Buhari who took military training in Kaduna as well as in Great Britain, India, and the United States became Nigerian military leader and politician who served as Nigeria’s head of state in 1984–85 and was democratically elected president in 2015. 8.In 2003 Buhari ran for president and was defeated by the incumbent, Olusegun Obasanjo of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Buhari ran again in 2007 but was defeated by the PDP’s candidate, Umaru Yar’Adua, in an election that was strongly criticized by international observers as being marred by voting irregularities. Buhari also stood in the 2011 presidential election, which was praised for largely being transparent, free, and fair, but he again lost to the PDP’s candidate, incumbent Goodluck Jonathan. 9. In December 2014, Muhammadu Buhari went on the record to say he would abolish the office of the First Lady if he was elected as President, claiming it was unconstitutional.The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a Nigerian militant group that endorsed Buhari during the 2015 general elections, commended Buhari for his plans and went on to say that the office of the First Lady was “obviously an irrelevant, fraudulent and unconstitutional office, whose only purpose is to further plunder the resources of the country. Since assuming the presidency on 29 May 2015, Buhari has yet to terminate the office of the First Lady. Aisha Buhari operates from the office of the First Lady as “wife of the President.” 10. On 26 February 2019, Buhari was elected to a second term, defeating People’s Democratic Party opponent Atiku Abubakar. INEC issued the certificate of return to President Buhari and Osinbajo on February 27, 2019. Whilst the country commemorate Democracy Day on May 29, in remembrance of May 29, 1999, when democracy was restored after a long term of military rule; Buhari changed it to June 12 for heroic remembrance of MKO Abiola, who won the June 12, 1993 election was overruled.
