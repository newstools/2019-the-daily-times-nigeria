Israeli doctors have developed an 
innovative medicine for heart failure, Kaplan Medical Centre in Central 
Israel reported on Tuesday. Heart failure is a state in which  the heart activity fails to the point of shortness of breath and edema,  the most common cause of mortality and hospitalisations over the age of  65. READ ALSO:india to launch 3rd moon mission in 2020 One of the main causes of heart 
failure is the amyloidosis disease (“Alzheimer’s of the heart”), protein
 accumulation in between the heart muscle cells, disrupting the heart’s 
activity. For many years, cardiac amyloidosis, like Alzheimer’s’, has been considered an incurable disease. Recently, for the first time, a drug
 that partially slows down the heart injury process was approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but the road to healing is 
still long. Kaplan Medical Center’s researchers,
 however, have developed the innovative drug that has the full healing 
potential of the disease. Their study, including successful animal experiments was published in the European Heart Journal. The new drug is an antibody that 
activates the immune system cells in the heart, so they will swallow and
 break down the amyloid protein that accumulates in the heart. This way, thus the cardiac muscle cells are protected and return to normal functioning. The next step, according to the 
researchers, is to apply these findings to the treatment of heart 
failure patients with amyloidosis background.
