FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello has disclosed that the restriction of commercial tricycle operators to certain parts of the city is one of the most difficult decisions that the FCT administration has had to make. Chief Press Secretary to the minister, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, in a statement on Sunday, said Bello disclosed this during the presentation of the FCT’s 2020 statutory budget to the joint sitting of the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on the FCT. The minister said that the decision was imperative because commercial tricycles by law should not operate on the expressway and highways along with vehicles as they pose dangers to both passengers and riders. According to the minister, most roads within the FCT were expressways and thus cannot accommodate the presence of the commercial tricycles and motorcycles. He however, said that the FCTA is not unmindful of the challenges commuters were facing as a result of the policy, adding that strategies were being put in place to improve on the public transportation situation in the FCT. Bello said that the FCTA is working closely with the commercial tricycle association to explore the possibility of upgrading their operations to taxi cabs.
