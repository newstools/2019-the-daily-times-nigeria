U.S president, Donald Trump has declined the invitation to attend this week’s impeachment hearing. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, last wednesday, invited Trump to attend the hearing “directly or through a counsel”, saying it would be an opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis for impeachment.

the committee of a “complete lack of due process and fundamental
fairness” , saying the invitation would fail to give the White House
adequate time to prepare and did not give information about the witnesses. Reports suggested witnesses were “apparently all academics” and
would include “no fact witnesses”, Mr Cipollone said. A fact witness
testifies their personal knowledge of events while an expert witness assists
the judge by offering an opinion. Mr Cipollone also said the committee had called three witnesses but allowed
Republicans to call just one, and lambasted Mr Nadler’s claim that the process
was “consistent” with historical impeachment inquiries, arguing that
President Bill Clinton had a fairer hearing in 1998. In order for Mr Trump to be represented in further hearings, the president’s
counsel said, Mr Nadler would need to ensure “that due process rights are
protected” and that the process was “fair and just”.
