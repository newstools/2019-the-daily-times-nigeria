Just take life easy. Don’t let people pressure you into doing something you do
not believe. I’ve tried to push a lot of things, but when I met my husband, he
changed things for me, in the sense that when I’m rushing to get things done,
he’ll be like “Calm down, calm down; things will fall in place”, and indeed
things have been falling in place. So, calm down!” The mother of twins  further revealed that her great accomplishment
as an actor is being able to impact the lives of young people, and help them
groom their potentials. “I achieve this by giving
them an opportunity. I have my production outfit, and with every series from
Scene One production, I try to empower as many people as possible. That’s a
great accomplishment for me. She said Adding that, “as a creative person, sometimes,  I get stuck. I’ve experienced it a lot, but this year has been mad! Because, after the arrival of my babies, I went back to work immediately. What I do when I feel stuck is I dump the work, take a walk, and go for a swim. I also enjoy watching excellent TV series like ‘Greenleaf.” “After the short break, my inspiration can happen the next day, in the shower.  I can start thinking about what to do with characters, and what their next moves should be before you know it, I’m bursting with fresh new ideas.” She noted.
