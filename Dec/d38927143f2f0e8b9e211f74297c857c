Brighton’s chief executive and deputy chairman, Paul Barber said via the club’s official website: “It’s both sad and depressing that once again we find ourselves having to address another situation of discriminatory abuse. “Prior to kick-off, we had a huge show of support for the Rainbow Laces campaign brilliantly backed by the vast majority of people inside the stadium, and yet before the game is over, we are forced to deal with these two individuals, who think it’s okay to behave in this way. “Working with Sussex Police, I’m pleased to report that once again our staff were able to take swift action, which hopefully will increase the chances of a conviction. We simply won’t stand for it at the Amex. “Once again, it’s very hard to comprehend why some individuals think it’s acceptable to behave in this way, but we are very clear that neither Brighton and Hove Albion, nor the wider football community, will tolerate homophobia or discrimination at any time, in any form. “We would urge any fans confronted with similar discriminatory behaviour to report it immediately, either directly to a steward or via our anonymous hotline, and we will take strong action.” Wolves released a club statement confirming Sussex Police’s investigation,. “Wolves can confirm that there were two arrests for homophobic abuse at yesterday’s game against Brighton and Hove Albion. “There is no room in football or society for discrimination of any kind, and the club strongly condemns such behaviour. “Our ethos at Wolves is about being ‘One Pack’ – an attitude our supporters are very passionate about and that extends to our relationships across the football community, regardless of rivalries on the pitch. “The club is now offering its support to Sussex Police in what is a criminal investigation.”
