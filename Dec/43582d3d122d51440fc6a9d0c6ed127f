An Ile-Ife Magistrates’ Court in Osun on Tuesday remanded two teenage
 ladies: Yemisi Moses, 18, Blessing Damilola, 18, and a man, Adebayo 
Adegboyega, 25, over alleged membership of a secret society. The Prosecutor, Insp Sunday Osanyintuyi, told the court that the 
defendants committed the offence on Dec. 29 around 2 p.m. at Orilonise 
Area, Ile-Ife. Osanyintuyi said that the defendants unlawfully belong to a secret 
society, called Eiye Confraternity, while also disturbing the peaceful 
atmosphere of Ile-Ife. He added that the defendants also had in their possession quantity of
 substance suspected to be Indian hemp weight 20kg, which they were 
allegedly selling. According to him, the defendants conducted themselves in a manner that may cause breach of public peace. The prosecutor stated further that the offence contravened sections 
3, 4, 62(A), 63(B) and 249(D) of the Criminal Code,  Laws of Osun, 
 2002. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the three-count charge
 of possession of Indian hemp, membership of secret society and breach 
of public peace. The Defence Counsel, Mr Ben Adidieje, applied for the bail of his 
clients in most liberal term, giving assurance that the defendants would
 not jump bail, but would provide substantial sureties. The Magistrate, Mr Joseph Owolawi, however, refused them bail, but 
ordered for their remand in Ilesa Correctional Centre, pending the rule 
on bail. Owolawi adjourned the case until Jan. 7, 2020 for hearing.
