You have to have the belief that you are good enough and you have that ability, not just in football but in everything you do in life. It comes from within, it’s either you have it or you don’t.” Asked to name his closest friend in the Super Eagles team, Iwobi said; ”In camp, it would probably be Ola Aina, growing up with him, we went to the same school, lived in the same road. Even till now we are still good friends.”
