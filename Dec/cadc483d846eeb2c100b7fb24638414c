As a result of the recent development about racism in the world of football, the menace has triggered concern from different football clubs, with a possible solution to the ugly trend through a campaign. Concerning a lasting solution to the problem, it has been recorded that FIFA has reacted positively to the issue, but Serie A have used three paintings of monkeys to illustrate a campaign to stamp out racism.

The idea was originally commissioned for the Coppa Italia final between Lazio and Atalanta in May even as the project was announced by the league on Monday. Explaining the importance and relationship of football to the initiative, Serie A chief executive Luigi De Siervo said,  “Sport, first and foremost football, is an extraordinary tool for conveying positive messages, fair play and tolerance,” “Simone’s paintings fully reflect these values and will remain on show in our headquarters. “We know that racism is an endemic and very complex problem, which we will tackle on three different levels  the cultural one, through works like that of Simone, the sporting one, with a series of initiatives together with clubs and players, and the repressive one, thanks to the collaboration with the police. “By acting simultaneously on these three different levels we are sure that we will be able to win the most important game against the evil that ruins the most beautiful sport in the world.” Italian football has been blighted by monkey chants and other incidents of racist abuse this season, even as Lukaku and Brescia forward Mario Balotelli were victims of the racist abuse recently.
