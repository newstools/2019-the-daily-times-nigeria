Enugu State Government will seal off no fewer than 3,000 property across the state for tax evasion, the Chairman, State Internal Revenue Services (SIRS), Mr Emeka Odo, has said.

The chairman said that the 3,000 institutions owed the state government a debt of N2.5 billion. “This exercise, which is still ongoing, involves the distrainment of a number of commercial establishments, banks and some private institutions. “They have refused to remit to the state government taxes they deducted from clients, staffers and others. “This exercise is pursuant to an ex-parte order from the High Court of Enugu State. It is expected that over 3,000 property will be affected by the work of the receiver managers,” he said. However, some owners of the property that were sealed off faulted the process and claimed that they did not owe. For instance, Mr Anthony Ifechukwu, the proprietor of Utopia Suites and Apartments, Independence Layout, Enugu, said that the enforcement would kill the businesses. According to him, he has fulfilled his financial obligations to the state government and there is no need to seal off his business premises. (NAN)
