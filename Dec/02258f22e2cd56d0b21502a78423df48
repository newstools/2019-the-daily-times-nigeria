The party urged INEC to withdraw the certificates of return and give them to the first runners up in the concluded elections, threatening to drag the electoral body to court if it fails to grant its request within seven days. Recall that the Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Francis Okiye, had declared 14 seats of the alleged absentees vacant. Okiye subsequently asked INEC to conduct bye-elections for the affected constituencies within 90 days. The 14 seats are those of the 12 members-elect who are yet to be inaugurated and two who allegedly stopped going to the state assembly after being inaugurated. The PDP, however, kicked against the call for fresh elections into the constituencies by Okiye, saying the certificates should be withdrawn and given to the first runners up instead of wasting money to conduct another election.
