Abuja – The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), has directed its personnel across the country to give preference to, and enroll, all applicants sitting for the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations (UTME).

Aziz said that the aim of the exercise was to ensure that all applicants sitting for the 2020 UTME are provided with their National Identity Number (NIN) in line  with the NIMC Act of 2007. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the move is part of the collaboration between NIMC and Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), which had made the acquisition of NIN compulsory for applicants sitting for 2020 UTM Exammination.

Aziz, therefore, advised parents and guardians to guide their wards in carefully filling the enrollment forms to ensure names and date of birth are registered correctly. He also enjoined school authorities and local education secretaries to inform and educate parents and students on the importance of obtaining their National Identity Number.(NAN)
