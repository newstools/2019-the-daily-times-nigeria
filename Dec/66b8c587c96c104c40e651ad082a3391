Tyson Fury has accepted Anthony Joshua’s offer to help him
prepare for his rematch with Deontay Wilder insisting he would “love” to have
his domestic rival in camp. Joshua, 30, has not always seen eye-to-eye with Fury amid calls for the British heavyweights to lock horns. READ ALSO:  Serie A unveil Anti-racism Monkey Paintings But ahead of his rematch with WBC champion Wilder in
February, Joshua expressed his willingness to spar the Gypsy King to help him
prepare. “Fury, if you need me for sparring… we’re gonna fight one
day, I sparred Tyson Fury when we were kids anyway,” the WBA ‘Super’, IBF and
WBO chief said on Sky Sports News. “I’d go out to America and spar Tyson Fury and get him ready
for this Wilder fight.” It did not take Fury long to respond, taking to his
Instagram story to welcome AJ into his training camp. “I’ve just seen a video of Joshua on Sky Sports saying he’d
love to come and help me in camp and that I’d fight him quicker than Wilder,”
he said. “That’s for sure. When I beat Wilder, I will fight you AJ.
No problem. “I would love to have you in camp. I’d really love to have
you in camp for this fight and give Wilder a proper beating. “Thanks very much and well done in your last fight,
congratulations.” Joshua propelled himself back to the top of the heavyweight
mountain earlier this month, putting on a boxing masterclass in his pivotal
rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr.
