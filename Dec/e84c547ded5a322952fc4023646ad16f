Alhaji Monsurudeen Bello, the Chairman of Ejigbo Local Government Community Development Area (LCDA) on Tuesday said that the council was already putting measures in place to clear canals in the council in order to prevent flooding. He disclosed this in an interview at the Faseun link bridge; a boundary between Ejigbo and Isolo LCDA, where he inspected the dredging of the canal. Niger govt begins urban policy sensitisation “The initiative was to transport cargo from the airport to Apapa that was the intention. But right now I think it has never been used for that purpose. “I believe water transportation is a possibility that can be explored in the nearest future to ease congestion around this axis. “So our intention is that let us clear the canal, create the path for water, by the time we get to the next raining season it will be easier for us to trace,” he said The chairman also called on the Lagos State Government to take advantage of shared boundaries and create more link bridges’ in order to ease vehicular movement around Ejigbo and Isolo LCDAs. “If you look at the number of hours saved from Iyana Ejigbo to Jakande, even to Pako, to Okota, if you are going to Apple junction Festac, taking this road and the other one there, you would have at least boycotted the bottleneck.” The chairman appealed to residents to manage their waste properly in order to prevent flooding. “It’s not just about the people in this LCDA, Nigerians as a whole need to stop desecrating canals, because the consequence is that their lives and properties will be endangered. Canals are not meant for dumping of garbage,’’ he said. (NAN)OAF/SO/ISMA
