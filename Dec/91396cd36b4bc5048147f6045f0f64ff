To accelerate access to quality and affordable healthcare in the country, healthcare providers and the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) have listed  ways Nigeria could achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030. According to them, UHC is achievable in Nigeria through effective collaboration with stakeholders in the health sector and strong political will on the part of government. The healthcare providers under the aegis of Healthcare Providers Association of Nigeria (HCPAN), also identified multi-sectoral approach as key  to achieving UHC in the country. Speaking at the 15th National Annual General Meeting (AGM2019) of HCPAN in Lagos with the theme:” Consolidating Health Insurance: The Winning Strategies”, President of the association,  Dr Adeyeye Arigbabuwo, said the way forward for health insurance in Nigeria was to have a paradigm shift in the way and manner at which the  government run the health insurance industry. Arigbabuwo stressed that the government must have the right  political will and also put the required structures and funding in place as obtained in other countries for Nigerians to enjoy UHC. “There is a need for unequivocal and unwavering political will to health insurance and UHC in Nigeria. There is need for cohesion of inter and intra professional relationship in the health sector. There is the need for  NHIS to get its rudder and compass well positioned to carry the followers along as she plays her regulatory roles, he said. The HCPAN leader further stated: “There  is a need for greater transparency much more than ever before. We need trust. We need to weigh our parameters and work on data. The private sector in Nigeria needs a better enabling environment from the government. He challenged state governments to buy into social health insurance without prejudice of looking at funds of support of Federal government. In his remarks , the Executive Secretary of  NHIS, Prof. Mohammed Sambo, assured that UHC is achievable in 2030 if Nigeria institutes a mechanism to control quality of health services in the country.
