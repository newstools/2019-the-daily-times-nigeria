The 27-year-old told France Football: “Why would I want to leave?

This season our main objective is the Champions League, and my priority is PSG. “The goal is always to win the next game. In every match, we have to push ourselves for the club. That’s the way I see it.” Neymar has contributed eight goals and five assists from 11 appearances this season.
