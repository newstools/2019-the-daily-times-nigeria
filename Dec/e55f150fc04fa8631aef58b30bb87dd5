Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has disclosed that arrangements are on top gear to attract a sum of $100 million from development partners in aid of critical infrastructure. Fayemi said some development partners have visited the state on how best they can collaborate with his administration in the areas of investment and economic empowerment for the people of the state. The Governor disclosed this while rendering account of his stewardship and receiving feedback with chairmen and secretaries of community development associations and town unions in his hometown, Isan Ekiti. Represented by the Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, Fayemi said his administration has injected some valuable inputs into the system to make Ekiti marketable to local and foreign investors. A statement signed by the Special Assistant (Media) to the Deputy Governor, Odunayo Ogunmola, revealed that the community leaders at the forum hailed Fayemi for touching every nook and cranny of the state with visible projects that have made life easier for residents. The Governor disclosed that from the beginning of year 2020, the state will witness massive construction of rural roads in a bid to tackle one of the problems militating against agriculture and rural development, one of the five pillars of his administration. Fayemi told the elated representatives of communities that a total of 1,000 kilometers of rural roads will either be reconstructed of rehabilitated while dredging of waterways for erosion control is already ongoing. The 2020 fiscal year, the Governor added, will witness renovation of all public schools to engender more conducive teaching and learning environment for pupils and teachers while grants were recently approved for the schools. While restating the commitment of his administration towards providing an enabling environment for socio-economic development, Fayemi appealed to community leaders to always release land for prospective investors who want to use it for either industrial or agricultural purposes. The Governor revealed that some of the community-initiated and self-help projects abandoned by the last administration has been given attention with some completed and commissioned for use. Fayemi explained that the state had witnessed the commissioning of 36 (thirty six) projects through the support of the World Bank with an affirmation to complete all other projects within the allotted scope of time. The Governor used the opportunity to give account of his investment drive within and outside the country which are yielding fruits in agriculture, industrialisation and other key sectors of the state’s economy. He said: “On the economic situation of the state, this administration has taken pragmatic approach by engaging and partnering development agencies and multinational organisations with a view to getting them to invest in our state. “To boost our infrastructure development, efforts are in top gear to attract a sum of $100 million to be invested in some critical infrastructure that are important to the acceleration of the socioeconomic development of our dear state. “For example, Promasidor has taken over Ikun Dairy Farm, and this is expected to provide jobs for our youths, improve our internally generated revenue and enhance the socio-economic standard of our people. “To realising our dream of optimising the full potential of our relationship with development partners, we have paid huge counterpart funds to many agencies, which has culminated to tremendous support that we have received, while others are under processing for Ekiti development.” Fayemi highlighted abolition of taxes on education, free health for the aged and vulnerable children, regular payment of salaries, subventions and pensions, building workers capacity, reduced backlog of gratuities as part of his achievements in the last one year.
