Former Abia State Governor Orji Kalu, on Tuesday, prayed the Federal High Court in Lagos to grant him bail because of his ill-health adding that his health requires the services of a herbalist. Kalu, who is serving a 12-year imprisonment for N7.65billion fraud and money laundering, hinged his request on two grounds: ill health and desire to return to the Senate. Breaking: EFCC kicks as convicted Orji Kalu begs court for bail Kalu told Justice Mohammad Liman that he was battling serious health challenges, which required him  to seek the  services of his “herbalist.” The Senate Chief Whip and senator representing Abia North District, claimed that the medical facilities in the Custodial Centre where he had spent 13 days cannot handle his ailment.. The Nation reports that Kalu’s counsel, Mr Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), yesterday, informed the court of a bail application he filed on behalf of the former governor, seeking to be released on bail, pending the outcome of his appeal against the judgment. He told the court that the application was premised on 23 grounds and supported by a 38-paragraph affidavit. Fagbemi said after receiving a counter-affidavit filed by the prosecution, he filed a 34-paragraph further affidavit with one exhibit attached. The SAN also drew the court’s attention to a notice of appeal against Kalu’s conviction, and relied on the provisions of Sections 241 of the Constitution in urging the court to grant the bail. “If there is a right of appeal, then, there is a corresponding right of bail pending appeal,” he said. Citing Sections 6 of the Constitution, Fagbemi argued that the court had the powers to entertain such an application since post-judgment jurisdiction were anchored on the section. He said the bail would enable Kalu to attend to his health and return to the National Assembly to serve the nation. But EFCC counsel, Mr RotimI Jacobs (SAN), opposed the bail application.
