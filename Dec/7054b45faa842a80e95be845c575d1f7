Abuja – The Presidency says the decision by the U.S. government to place Nigeria on its Watch List does make Nigeria a country of concern on religious freedom. Speaking  on this development, Malam Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, said Nigeria and the U.S. would deliberate on the matter early next year.

We are looking forward to such discussions with our partners, the U.S.’’ The presidential aide maintained that Nigeria as geo-political entity had no policy that promotes one religion against the other. According to Shehu, the right to freedom of worship for all citizens is guaranteed in the Nigerian constitution. “We have no policy that promotes one religion against the other. “The right to freedom is guaranteed by the constitution and we have no problem observing that,’’ he said. U.S. government was last week reported to have added Nigeria to a “Special Watch List (SWL)” of countries that have engaged in or tolerated “severe violations of religious freedom”. The inclusion of Nigeria in the religion violations list, which has continued to attract mixed reactions, was announced by the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo.
