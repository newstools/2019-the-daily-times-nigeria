He said: “In a presidential system of government, there is room for checks on what any arm of government is doing by the other.

President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, in his concluding remarks after the 2020 budget was passed, said: “When we came in, all of us approved our legislative agenda, and one of the key pillars of this agenda is to take back our budget cycle from the very undesirable cycle that cannot be defined to something that can be defined and bought into by our country and business partners living in and outside the country. “Today, we have been able to achieve this. It means where there is will, there is always a way. This is something that we have been able to achieve together with the House of Representatives. “I must give members of the Ninth National Assembly the credit, because we thought it was going to be impossible. “Let me also commend the buying-in of the executive arm of government. When we continued to preach that we have to receive the 2020 budget estimates before the end of September, it was not easy for the executive. “I know they (Executive) worked day and night. So it was presented to us on the 8th of October. We have been able to work harmoniously. There is no way we can achieve this without all of us working together. “I want to commend our colleagues from the opposition. This Senate from the beginning, we said, will be bi-partisan. You have given us all the support that we require, and indeed, this is the way it should be”, Lawan added. The Senate President also noted that with the recent passage of landmark legislations such as the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) Act, Finance Bills and Public Procurement Bills by the National Assembly, the Executive arm of government is sufficiently empowered to ensure the successful implementation of the 2020 budget. Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has expressed satisfaction with the 9th National Assembly over early passage of the 2020 budget. The party described this as a development that is sure to return Nigeria to the normal January to December budget cycle and another solid milestone by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration. The party commended  both chambers of the National Assembly – Senate and House of Representatives, for putting National Interest before any other interest, which is a clear departure from the 8th National Assembly which it said “used filibustering, political manipulation and other devious practices in their failed attempt to sabotage the APC government”. The party in a statement by national publicity secretary, Lanre Issa – Onilu, also commend President Muhammadu Buhari for showing leadership in the prompt submission of the 2020 budget proposals and his clear directive to heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies to suspend international travels to defend their respective budgets and provide the required cooperation to the National Assembly in order to ensure timely passage of the 2020 budget. “Nigerians will be the ultimate beneficiaries of the early budget passage as it will guarantee full implementation of many of the economic, infrastructural, social investments and other developmental programmes contained in the budget and which will directly and positively impact on the people. “Again, the early budget passage will allow for proper and better planning for both the government and the private sector. The entire financial architecture of our country would benefit from this. This includes project financing, contract execution timeline, project implementation and performance monitoring. It will make public procurement predictable, business climate stable, and give confidence to investors”, said the party. The APC urged the executive and legislature to take full advantage of this new dawn of cordial relations, stressing that this will ultimately translate to better governance for the benefit of Nigerians.
