Daily Times reports that Adoke was handed over to the EFCC by International Police Organisation (INTERPOL) on Thursday and taken into custody for his alleged involvement in the granting of the Oil Prospecting License (OPL) 245 to Shell and ENI.

The anti-graft agency had sought a request from the Court in Abuja on April 17 to secure a warrant of arrest against Adoke and four others, after attempts to produce the defendants in court failed. The court granted the request by the EFCC, leading to Adoke’s arrest by the police in Dubai in November. His arrest was confirmed by the Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), Professor Itse Sagay, during a courtesy visit to the EFCC headquarters (channels).
