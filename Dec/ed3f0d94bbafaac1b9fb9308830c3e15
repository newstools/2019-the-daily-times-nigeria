They also provide customers and those in need with the necessary financial products.  Banks provide access to low-cost financial products that can be particularly valuable for “unbanked” (those that do not have bank accounts, ) and “underbanked” clients (those who have accounts but underutilize them)” he said.” Connecting  financial  education  with  financial  products allows  all  individuals  to  become  fully  integrated  in  the traditional financial system, setting them on the path to wealth accumulation. Financial literacy programs can also create goodwill at the community level and strengthen relationships with local customers and community partners” he said.
