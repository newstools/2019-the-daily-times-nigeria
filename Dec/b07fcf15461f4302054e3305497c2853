An Upper Area Court sitting in Kasuwan Nama in Jos on Thursday, sentenced a 22-year-old-trader, Yusuf Musa, to one year imprisonment for stealing chicken. The Judge, Yahaya Mohammed, sentenced Musa after he pleaded guilty to stealing the chicken. Student in court over alleged theft of 16 ATM cards Mohammed, however, gave the convict an option of N10, 000 fine but in default, he is to spend a year in prison. He said the judgment would serve as a deterrent to those who would want to indulge in such act of stealing. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Ibrahim Gokwat, told the court that the case was reported on Dec. 15, at the Laranto Police Station by Steven Pam of Lomak St., Laranto area in Jos, who was the complainant. The prosecutor alleged that the chickens were crying out and when the owner went out to check on them, he saw the convict and his friend now at large with the chicken in their hands. “The owner shouted and they dropped the chicken and ran away but neighbours ran after them and caught one of them,’’ Gokwat said. On arraignment, the accused pleaded guilty and begged the court for leniency. The prosecutor said the offence contravened Sections 58 and 272 of Plateau State Penal Code Law. (NAN)
