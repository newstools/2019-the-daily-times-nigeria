Pep Guardiola has ruled out Manchester City signing any new players in the upcoming January transfer window, saying he “doesn’t want” any arrivals. Man City have been short of options in central defence this season with Aymeric Laporte still out with a long-term injury, while John Stones also missed eight matches during September and October with a muscle problem.

But that is not possible. Normally the players we think could be interesting, clubs are not going to sell them. “We could not sign a centre-back in the summer. We decided to adapt Fernandinho in this position and that’s all. Sometimes the club wants to try to do the best but sometimes we cannot. We have to adapt with the players that we have. “Vincent decided to go to Belgium. We have another alternative in other players and I’m thinking about that. No [we don’t miss him], the group is extraordinary. They are incredible. They take of themselves perfectly, have an incredible unit. “Vincent is and was and will be an important player and person for this club. But he decided to go to Belgium and we have other incredible players to try to do the job they have to do.”
