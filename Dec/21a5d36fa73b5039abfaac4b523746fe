Ayodeji Omoyeigha, told the court that the defendant on Sept. 3 at 12:30p.m., conducted himself in an unruly manner at a Bet9ja shop along Aye-Ore Road in Okitipupa Magisterial District. The prosecutor added that the defendant also conducted himself in a manner likely to have caused a breach of the peace by not paying the sum he staked in a lottery. He said that the defendant also stole N175,000 belonging to one Oluwaseun Enikanolaye, the owner of the lotto shop.

The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges levelled against him. The chief magistrate, Mr Dickson Ogunfuyi, admitted the defendant to a bail of N50,000 and a surety in like sum. He said that the surety must provide evidence   of a year’s tax clearance paid to the state government. He adjourned the case until Dec. 23 for further hearing. (NAN)
