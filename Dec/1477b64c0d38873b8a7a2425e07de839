The remains of six people were recovered late on Friday from the wreckage of a helicopter that crashed at a mountainous state park on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, authorities said. A seventh passenger on the chopper, which went down while touring Kauai’s Na Pali Coast on Thursday, had not been located, according to officials. But there were no indications anybody survived the crash.
