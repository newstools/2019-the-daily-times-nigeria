The gymnasts’ coach, Tony Asuquo, had told the Minister that the young gymnasts can compete and win medals for Nigeria anywhere in the world with the level of hard work they have put in. He said, “with the levels we have here, they can compete in the US, in Russia, name it. They can compete anywhere in the world and win medals. We look forward to the coming National Sports Festival next year to see them also compete there”. The gymnasts put up a show to display their gymnastics skills to the Minister delight.
