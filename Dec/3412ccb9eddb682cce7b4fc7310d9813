On the issue of Brexit, he said that it would offer more and better opportunities to study in the UK universities. “Brexit doesn’t affect Nigerian coming to study in UK. We welcome all students from all over the world because we want diversity in the UK. “We are working in a global village and the ability to work cross culture and in multiple teams across different countries is an important skill that graduates need,” he said. He, therefore, said that the global expansion would give students access to global communities through exchange programmes, internships, placements, volunteering and digital collaboration.
