PenCom recently stated that it was striving to capture the remaining 90 million Nigeria’s working population into the pension scheme. PenCom Acting Director-General, Aisha Dahiru Umar, had said out of the 90 million people excluded from the scheme, her agency was planning to capture about 17 million that are self-employed and engaged in small businesses through the micro pension scheme. However, she had said about 70 per cent of the working population had no bank accounts, let alone pension scheme because of lack of means of identification and poor financial behaviours.She stated that the above growth justified the commission’s emphasis on the safety of pension funds as the bedrock of sustaining the CPS and assured all stakeholders that the pension reform remains steadily on course.
