India will launch its third mission to the moon in the year 2020, the Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday. The newspaper quoted India’s junior minister for the department of  space Jitendra Singh as saying that third lunar mission Chandrayaan-3  would attempt a soft landing on the moon again.

attempt; the U.S. took several attempts. But we will not need so many 
attempts,” Singh was quoted as saying. India’s second lunar mission lander Chandrayaan 2 had lost contact 
shortly before the scheduled attempt to soft-land on the moon on Sept. 
7.
Chandrayaan 2 was launched on July 22 from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). If India had succeeded in its endeavour, it would have become the 
fourth country to soft-land a spacecraft on the lunar surface after the 
U.S., Russia and China. Earlier this month, U.S. space agency National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) said its satellite orbiting the moon had found the
 debris of India’s crashed moon lander Chandrayaan 2.
