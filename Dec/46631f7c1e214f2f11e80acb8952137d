Dreams really do come TRUE! 💫💋Congrats to #Brodashaggi 😂 pic.twitter.com/rm1k6Qyf0n Comedian Brodashaggi is now the son-in-law of billionaire Femi Otedola, after he commented on a viral video in which her ‘angel daughter’ DJ Cuppy appears to kiss the comedian. “My son-in-law”, Femi Otedola commented, obviously jokingly, amidst the thousands of retweets and comments the video has generated. In her own post of the video, DJ Cuppy tantalisingly wrote:Dreams do come through, breaking her comment with a kissing emoji and then adding : congrats to Brodashaggi. Brodashaggi, real name Samuel Perry, must have been in a dreamworld for landing a kiss with Cuppy as the video shows him collapsing afterwards. He wrote: “FINALLY, I kissed Dj Coppied(Sic)”.
