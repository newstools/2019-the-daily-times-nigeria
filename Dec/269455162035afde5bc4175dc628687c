Musa said the court delivered the verdict after due diligence established a conspiracy between the persons, as such he convicted and sentenced the two INEC staff to seven years each on the three counts brought against them by the EFCC. The judge said he was giving a lenient sentence since the accused were first-term offenders adding that the sentence would run concurrently. “The offence has a mandatory provision. I’m constrained by the law. They shall be sentenced to seven years imprisonment without the option of fine. ” However in view of plea to temper justice with mercy, I will allow the sentence to run concurrently,” he said.
