The strategy is also expected to equip 50 million young African people with employable skills that enable them to access economic opportunities and realize their full economic potential across the continent. “The Tony Elumelu Foundation entrepreneurship programme will deliver business training, mentoring, access to networks, markets and capital for business development to selected youth-led start-ups in order for them to grow and create jobs. “The entrepreneurship programme demonstrates a strong alignment with the bank’s youth entrepreneurship and innovation multi-donor trust fund objectives to build the African youth entrepreneurship ecosystem by scaling innovative youth-led start-ups, expanding youth market opportunities and improving youth access to finance.” Other development partners involved in supporting the entrepreneurship programme are Agence Française de Développement, the German Agency for International Cooperation, the United Nations Development Programme and the International Committee of the Red Cross. In 2017, the AfDB established the youth entrepreneurship and innovation multi-donor trust fund, in partnership with the governments of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands to support Africa’s entrepreneurship ecosystem.
