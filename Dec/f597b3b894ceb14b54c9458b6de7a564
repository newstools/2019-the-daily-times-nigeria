Talented Nollywood producer/actor, Olushola Micheals have revealed that his passion for the creative industry have been what has kept him to continuously invest in quality movie productions despite not reaping the huge amount involved in such a production and as such the reason why he is currently channeling effort to change the narratives in the movie industry irrespective of the genre of production. He said ‘ I’m looking into changing the narrative where this cartel has been in the industry for a while. I don’t like the idea where each time I switch on my television, there are certain people who do a so-called English movie. Also, as a producer, each time I said I want to produce a movie, I was told: ‘If this or that person are not going to be in the movie, we won’t buy it.’ I have actually produced a movie, gave it to a marketer and they refused it simply because the director is a Yoruba man or he is not part of their caucus. So, why is that? As long as the storyline is good, why do I have to bring your clique into my production? In the next two years, I’m looking into changing the narrative’. On keeping up his game as an actor/producer, Micheals noted that as a creative person, once you have good production at hand, fantastic story line, quality picture output amongst others; the industry will have no choice than to reckon with your brand. However, with over 14 unreleased movies; Olushola Micheals is not giving up anytime soon as he had at hand a quality movie that includes Irin Ajo, Like mother Like son, Crack, The Messenger and Tafa Onimoto among others.
