A smuggler who hid 385 litres of premium motor spirit (PMS) better known as petrol in 2 caskets, has been nabbed by the joint anti-bunkering team of the Nigeria Customs Service. Abdullahi Maiwada, Nigerian Customs Service Ogun 1 Area Command spokesperson confirmed the arrest on Wednesday December 4. He said the petrol kept in 13 Jerry cans of 25 litres and six Jerry cans of 10 litres was concealed in two new caskets which were placed in a rickety Mazda 626 with Lagos number LSD 617 CW. We therefore appeal to the general public to embrace legitimate means of livelihood and to avoid smuggling in all its ramifications. The eagle eye is all around Ogun state to halt new techniques initiated by economic saboteurs to perpetuate their illicit acts‚Äù, Maiwada said. This is coming after the NCS banned supply of fuel to stations 20 kilometres to the borders.
