Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja As a follow up to the Presidential launch of the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF) in January 2019, the Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewole, has announced that the Pilot scheme of the programme would be flagged off in the State of Osun, Niger, Katsina and Abia States. Speaking on the development in Abuja, Professor Adewole said that the programme was the Federal Governmentâ€™s direct response to addressing high inequalities in access to quality Health Care and eliminating out of pocket expenses for Primary health care services in order to improve health outcomes in Nigeria. To achieve that goal, the Minister explained, that the Fund would provide one Primary Health Care Centre, per ward, identified by States (based on defined criteria) with operational budgets to enable those facilities improve service delivery. Also, the BHCPF, now known as HUWE, would reimburse facilities for delivering the specified package of services which include:- Ante-natal care, Delivery (including Caesarean Sections), family planning, treatment of childhood under Five(5) illnesses, malaria treatment for all and screening for Non- Communicable Disease; Adewole added. He stated that HUWE had also made provision for the increased Public Health Emergency Response to ensure that Nigerians were able to receive Emergency Medical treatment. He further mentioned that services covered under the program, would be delivered in both Public and Private Care Facilities thus ensuring that facilities focused on quality improvement to gain market share. HUWE will be funded through not less than 1% of the Consolidated Revenue of the Federation as stipulated in the National Health Act, 2014. It also provides room for funding from Donor Organisations and other sources.
