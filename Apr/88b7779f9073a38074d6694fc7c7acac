Consequently, Profit before Tax (PBT) was maintained at N5.4 billion, consistent with Q1 2018. “In line with our priorities, we recorded a material improvement of 819 per cent in loan recoveries with N2.8 billion recovered during the period. Our asset quality continues to improve, with Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) down to 7.8 per cent from 8.7per cent as at December 2018. “We are employing a multi-pronged approach focused on increasing revenue and optimising cost to ensure we deliver enhanced performance in 2019.” Speaking on the Q1 2019 numbers, the Chief Financial Officer, Union Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Joe Mbulu said, “The Group’s resilience in a challenged environment is demonstrated in these first quarter numbers. While Gross Earnings declined by five per cent to N37.7 billion from N39.5 billion in Q1 2018 due to loan book resolutions from the previous year, our Non-Interest Income grew by 39per cent from N7.8 billion to N10.8 billion driven by recoveries, credit-related fees and dividends from investments. “Operating Expenses increased marginally by four per cent QoQ, reflecting adjustment to staff compensation to strengthen our workforce; and increased depreciation expenses from technology investments to strengthen our treasury and transaction banking platforms in 2018, in line with our desire to lead in the transaction banking space. With the commencement of our Long-term Efficiency Acceleration Programme (LEAP), we expect to record savings on the expense line in 2019.
