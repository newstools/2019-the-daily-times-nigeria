The Wukari Local Government branch of the Tiv Cultural and Social Association, Taraba state on Tuesday rejected what they described as a one -sided peace committee in resolving the perennial Jukun/Tiv crisis in the area. This is contained in a press statement issued in Jalingo and signed by the association’s Chairman, Elder Paul Igo and Secretary, Mr. Anthony Shembee respectively. The association in the statement condemned the senseless killings and destructions occasioned by the Jukun/Tiv crisis which largely affected the Tiv people of Taraba state and faulted the non-inclusion of Tiv people of Taraba state origin in the peace committee. “We commend the move by the government of Taraba and Benue in constituting a peace and reconciliation committee that would bring lasting solution to this lingering crisis. “In as much as we commend the initiative to constitute a peace committee, we reject in its entirety the non-inclusion of a Tiv person from Wukari Local Government Area of Taraba state in the committee. “We want to place it on record that Kente, where the crisis started is in Taraba state and the public should note that Ikyaior, Gbor-Gbor, Iorlumun Nege, Ioryina Tor-Musa and Tar-Orshi among other communities that were burnt down in the crisis by Jukun youths are all in Taraba state,” the association stated. The body noted that the non-inclusion of the Tiv people of Taraba state in the committee was a deliberate move by some actors to sell a wrong narrative to the public that the crisis is between the Jukun of Taraba state and the Tiv of Benue state. The association which said they viewed the non-inclusion of the Tiv people from Wukari council in the committee as an oversight on the side of the government of Taraba state called for a review of the committee’s membership.
