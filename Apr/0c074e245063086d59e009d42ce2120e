A Pan-Igbo political pressure group, Ndigbo Unity Forum (NUF), has urged Ohaneze Ndigbo and its affiliate wings to remain apolitical to function effectively in the Igbo socio-cultural space. President of NUF, Augustine Chukwudum, who made the appeal in a statement made available to journalists in Enugu, noted that Ohaneze, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization was drifting away from the ideals of its founding fathers. He stated that the recent interference of Ohaneze Youth Council (OYC) on the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) leadership crisis was misguided, insisting that the OYC does not have any right to tell APGA members how they should run their party affairs. “This is the time for us, Ndigbo, all over the world to call Ohaneze and its wings to order as things are already going out of hand. NUF is raising this alarm so that the group should stop using Ndigbo for political interest. “We all know what happened before the 20l9 presidential election where Ohaneze leadership endorsed the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) without the consent of prominent Igbo sons and daughters as well as nobles. “That is why we must call them to order for them to know their function as a purely socio-cultural group,’’ he said.
