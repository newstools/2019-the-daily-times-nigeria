Samuel Luka, Bauchi The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) has warned that it will no longer tolerate mindless attacks, intimidation and harassment of journalists in the country. “The fact that you are a journalist does not make you a criminal. Journalism is not a crime; you are only contributing to building a sane society. Therefore, all these mindless attacks, clampdown, assault, harassment and intimidation, we will not tolerate it, never,” the NUJ National President, Chris Isiguzo said. Chris Isiguzo, who gave the warning while interacting with journalists in Bauchi state on Sunday, was in the state for the one-year remembrance service for the mother of Shuaibu Leman, the NUJ national secretary. “Quite recently, a journalist was picked up and you may recall he was in detention for two years before he was picked up again. For the second time, he was picked up, remember I did tell you that under our watch, we will not allow anyone mess any of you up. With our small intervention, he was released. “I can assure you that wherever it happens and any journalist that is touched anywhere, those who have done that should bear it in mind that they have touched the apple of their eyes and we will get justice for such members no matter what it takes. I am reiterating it, in fact, the safety of journalists has become a mantra for us,” Isiguzo further stated. He maintained that because the media practice is key to the survival of democracy in the country, his administration has prioritized the training and re-training of journalists in the country to boost their capacity and efficiency. “I promise you that I will take the issue of training and re-training of journalists seriously because a journalist that is stagnant is a danger to the society,” the NUJ national president said. Isiguzo said that the issue of insurance for practicing journalists has featured in all the state councils he has visited, promising that the union’s insurance scheme of would be reactivated.
