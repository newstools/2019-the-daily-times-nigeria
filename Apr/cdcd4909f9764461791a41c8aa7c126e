I congratulate the labour unions in Nigeria for this feat and I believe that with the same kind of determination, it is possible to further improve the lots of the Nigerian worker. “With the efforts and creative energies of Nigerian workers, I believe that it is very possible to create economic buoyancy in Nigeria and redefine our destiny in the world as a centre of prosperity and refuse to be the capital of the world’s poor people. “I want to join several other well-wishers to celebrate with Nigerian workers on today’s Workers Day and also to assure the labour unions of an acknowledgement of their great sacrifices for the country,” Atiku said. The former Vice President therefore, urged the organized labour under their various professional unions to embrace the paths of peace, harmony and national unity in all their engagements with employers of labour and governments at all levels.
