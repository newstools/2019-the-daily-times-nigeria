Ukpono Ukpong, Abuja As part of the activities lined up to mark this year’s May Day Celebrations in this year of the Centenary of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the organised labour yesterday hit the major streets of Abuja in a protest march to demand chief among, the immediate implementation of the new minimum wage across all categories of workers. During the march tagged “March for Jobs, Labour Rights and Shared Prosperity” which commenced by 8:00am at the Labour house through the Federal Secretariat, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Secretary General, Peter Ozo-Ezon, said the new wage which was signed into law by President Buhari was long overdue so it need no much rigmarole before the implementation begins. He stressed the need for the workers to be carried along in the sharing of the nations wealth, being a major player, the stimulator and money spinning machine for the country’s economy. “The new minimum wage must affect all categories of workers, both those in the public as well as private sector. “The workers have been looked down, cheated and as being at the receiving end for too long. “Time has come that workers must smile and it shouldn’t take long for that to happen.” He said
