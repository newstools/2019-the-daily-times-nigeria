Theresa May has warned Labour that she’ll give it just one more week before pulling the plug on cross-party talks aimed at finding a new Brexit deal. The Prime Minister has reportedly given MPs until the middle of next week to come up with something that will be supported by both sides of the House of Commons. Talks between senior Tories and Labour MPs have been going on for weeks and despite de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington claiming on Monday the talks were ‘positive’ and ‘productive’  very little has actually been confirmed. May’s government are seeking to forge a consensus with Labour to help get a Brexit deal approved by parliament in order to avoid no deal. She wants to leave the European Union as soon as possible and despite gaining an extension of Article 50 until October had still pinned hopes on leaving before the European Parliament elections in May. According to government sources, if Labour agrees not to block May’s withdrawal bill again, she will bring it back to the Commons. If no agreement is made, the government will ‘move in another direction’, the Independent reports. Earlier, May’s spokesman had declined to set an end date for the talks and instead said the latest meetings between both sides were ‘serious and constructive’.
