By Moses Oyediran, Enugu Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state will on May 7 deliver the maiden Prof. Miriam Ikejiani-Clark memorial lecture organized by the Department of Political Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Head of the Department of Political Science, Dr. Ifeanyichukwu Abada, who disclosed this in Nsukka on Monday while briefing newsmen, said the title of the lecture is: “The state and management of farmers’/herdsmen conflict in Nigeria: Lessons from the Benue valley.” Dr. Abada said the department decided to honour and institute a memorial lecture for Ikejiani-Clark because of her numerous contributions to the country and political science in particular. “It is in recognition of the sterling qualities and contributions of Ikejiani-Clark that the department deemed it necessary to immortalize her by instituting a lecture series. “Gov. Ortom of Benue state will deliver the maiden memorial lecture on May 7, at Princeness Alexandra Auditorium by 11am. Prof Benjamin Ozumba the vice chancellor of UNN will be the chief host of the occasion,” he said. He said until the death of Ikejiani-Clark in 2011, some of the positions she held in the university include, dean faculty of social sciences, head of department of political science and coordinator of post-graduate programme among others. Abada said the erudite professor also held public appointments. In 1983, she was appointed the commissioner of land, survey and town planning during the administration of Gov. C. C. Onoh, in the old Anambra state. Late Ikejiani-Clark was also appointed a minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT) from 1995 -1997 and it was during her time that the popular Dei Dei Building Material Market in Abuja was established.
