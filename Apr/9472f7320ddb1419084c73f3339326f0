Normalcy has returned to Gombe, the capital of Gombe state and its environs after the imposition of a 15-hour curfew on the city by the state government in response to the prevailing security situation in the area. The state government imposed the curfew on April 27, but however, relaxed the order on Sunday after due consultations with the security agencies in the state. The tense situation in the state started on Easter Sunday, when a vehicle killed 10 members of the Boys Brigade during a procession, while 30 others sustained various degrees of injury. On Saturday, when the bodies of the victims were being taken for burial, the city became tense as some youth threatened retaliation over the killings, hence throwing the town into confusion and this, compelled the state government to impose the curfew. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Mary Malum, confirmed that normalcy had returned to the town and that security personnel had been deployed at strategic locations to monitor and respond swiftly to any threat to peace. Malum called on the people of the state to be law abiding, even as reports say that motor parks, schools, markets and other business outfits that were hitherto, shut have now reopened for normal activities.
