There has been this controversy about the removal of the CJN. What is your take on this matter? You were once a founding member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). What made you into defect to All Progressives Congress (APC)? What is your rating of INEC’s preparedness for the rescheduled general elections slated for February 26 and 9thMarch 2019? The big task assigned to you as the Director General of the Lalong/Tyoden campaign is enormous. How prepare are you to deliver this assignment? Are you happy with the statement credited to the former governor of the state, Senator Jonah David Jang  that he built a Government House and someone else is occupying it and that they are coming back to take over the Government House. What is your take? There have been complaints about the delay of workers’ salaries recently. Will this not affect the governor’s chances in the forth-coming governorship election? What is your message to Nigerians especially APC supporters during the general elections?
