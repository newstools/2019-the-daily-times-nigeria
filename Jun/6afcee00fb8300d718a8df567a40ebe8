By Abiodun Taiwo, Abeokuta Following series of protest from residents and landlords in Ejio, an agrarian town in Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun state, the Elejio of Ejio, Oba Olusesan Ogunmuyiwa has appealed to the federal government and the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to expedite action on the planned compensation of house owners in Iludun area of the town. The compensation is for owners of buildings that would be affected by the construction of a proposed power sub-station in the town. Oba Ogunmuyiwa made the appeal while addressing representatives of the Iludun Landlords Association and other residents of the area who visited his palace to protest following rumours that land grabbers had invaded the community to forcefully take over their lands. The traditional ruler noted that there was no land grabber in the community, but the federal government through the Transmission Company of Nigeria needs the land for the benefit of the state and the country in general. He said the transmission company is planning to construct a $200 million power transmission project in five different locations in the state, including Ejio, adding that the project when completed will address the inadequacy of the country’s power transmission capacity. The monarch added that the project will also increase available power to industrial concerns and the populace, adding that the land acquired in the community would be used for building the sub- stations- that will help to expand the nation’s power transmission capacity. While assuring his people of adequate compensation by the federal government, the traditional ruler added that compensation will be paid to individual landlords in the community, stressing that government will not pay anybody by proxy. Earlier, the representatives of the landlords had expressed their readiness to cooperate with the federal government by releasing their properties for the development of the country.
