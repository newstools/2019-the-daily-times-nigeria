The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board will meet with stakeholders on Tuesday to decide the cut-off mark for the 2019/2020 admission. The 2019 Policy Meeting with stakeholder will hold on Tuesday, June 11 at Gbongan, Osun State. JAMB’s Head of Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin disclosed this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Benjamin said the official cut-off marks for the 2019/2020 admission would be made public at the end of the policy meeting. He advised candidates to disregard any cut-off mark being peddled by fraudsters, describing it as “fake.” He said: “The clarification became necessary following speculations that the board had fixed the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) cut-off marks. “It is pertinent to note that the heads of institutions and other stakeholders will do so at a policy meeting which is chaired by the Honourable Minister of Education. The board has scheduled the 2019 Policy Meeting for June 11 at Gbongan, Osun State.” The board added that candidates should not also believe some rumour that a candidate could have two different results released by the server. Benjamin also advised candidates to print their admission letter as they may not have been deemed to have been admitted. Meanwhile, the board said it has successfully secured conviction for fifteen persons who were involved in double registration, examination malpractice and other infractions during the conduct of the UTME. The board said some of the convictions were secured in Zamfara, Kebbi and other states.
