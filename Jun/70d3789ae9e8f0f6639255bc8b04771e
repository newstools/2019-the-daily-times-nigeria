Ukpono Ukpong, Abuja As part of preparations for the centenary anniversary celebration of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the Federal Government has set up an Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Planning of the 2019 Global Youth Empowerment Forum (GYEF). Inaugurating the Committee in Abuja, Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, William Alo, said the Forum which is scheduled to hold in Abuja from 1st to 3rd August, 2019, would attract no fewer than 250 delegates from across the globe, bringing together youth, policy makers, and social partners to exchange views, share experiences and provide ideas on how to foster decent work for the youths. He said the Forum will further create a platform for young people to engage in participatory and in-depth discussions on the most burning issues surrounding youth employment. The Permanent Secretary noted that the constitution of the Inter-Ministerial Committee is as a result of FG’s commitment to ensuring the success of the international event. Speaking further, he said that in considering Nigeria for the GYEF, the ILO took into consideration the country’s leadership role in youth-led development initiatives across Africa. The terms of reference for the Committee are: to make adequate security arrangement for the Forum; provide and ease immigration services for international delegates to the Forum, facilitate protocol arrangements for officials of ILO member states and other United Nations Agencies expected at the GYEF, and to work with the ILO Country office in Nigeria in the coordination and harmonization of the activities of the GYEF, among others. The Permanent Secretary charged members of the committee to employ dedication, integrity and conscientiousness in discharging the task given them. “This is a rare privilege extended to us as a nation and we have the responsibility to justify the confidence reposed on us.” He said In his remarks, the ILO Country Director, Dennis Zulu, whic was represented by represented by Dino Corell, revealed that this is the first time GYEF would be held in any part of the world outside Geneva. “The last one was held in 2012 in Geneva.
