Senator Oluremi Tinubu representing Lagos Central Senatorial District has felicitated with all lovers of democracy in Nigeria and in particular, citizens of the senatorial district who along with other Lagosians, played courageous and significant roles in the events that made June 12, 1993 historic and consequential. The senator stated that it has taken 26 years to witness the very first observance of June 12 as Nigeria’s Democracy Day. She recalled that it was on June 12, 1993 that Nigerians from all tribes, walks of life and religious affiliations indicated their clear and resolute preference for democracy and all its ideals. In a statement she personally signed and made available to Daily Times on Tuesday, titled: “A new beginning,” the senator saluted the man who personified everything lofty and laudable that June 12 now represents, the late Bashorun M. K. O. Abiola. She commended President Muhammadu Buhari, whose government finally deemed it fit to recognise June 12 as the date that truly deserves recognition as Nigeria’s rightful Democracy Day. The statement reads in part: “I honour the men and women who sacrificed their freedom, resources, safety and properties in the struggle for the actualisation of the mandate of Bashorun M.K.O. Abiola which was freely given on June 12, 1993 and thereafter for the recognition of June 12 as Nigeria’s Democracy Day. “More importantly, we cannot but recall and honour the memory of those who paid the ultimate price in the struggle. May their souls rest in peace and may our efforts be worthy of their huge sacrifice.” She called on all Nigerians and all political office holders to be challenged by the sacrifice of our heroes past and to use the occasion of this first observance of June 12 as Nigeria’s Democracy Day to rededicate themselves to the ideals of unity, peace and progress on which our nation was founded.
