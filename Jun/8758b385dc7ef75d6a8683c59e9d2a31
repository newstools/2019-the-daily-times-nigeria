A corp member serving in Osun state and diagnosed with acute kidney disease, John Fidelis, has called for help from well -meaning Nigerians. Fidelis, who hails from Ogwashi-Ukwu in Delta state was diagnosed with the disease since September 2008 and needs N10.5 million for treatment. The corps member with NYSC call-up number/OSU/2019/000089, graduated with second class lower from the Osun state University in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning. “My father, who was a pastor at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Province 1, Osogbo is also down with glaucoma and is currently blind,” Fidelis said. The father of the ailing corps member, Obi, who is blind, told newsmen at the NUJ Correspondents’ Chapel on Friday in Osogbo that his son’s present condition exacerbated the level of sorrow his blindness has caused the family since 2012. According to him, the loss of sight forced him out of the pulpit as a pastor and rendered him completely incapacitated in the past seven years. “This is the darkest moment in our family; our problem was compounded with the recent condition of my son, as he was diagnosed with kidney failure. It was due to his condition that we sought for redeployment from his place of primary assignment in Oyo state back to Osogbo. “He has been on dialysis since then at Ladoke Akintola University Teaching Hospital. The hospital has recommended transplant to us, which will cost N10.5million that is why we are appealing to spirited Nigerians to come to our aid and help my son. “I am indeed, helpless since I lost my sight to glaucoma, it has been a serious trauma for me and my family, we need serious help,” Fidelis pleaded.
