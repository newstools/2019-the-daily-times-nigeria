Mathew Dadiya, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has restated the nation’s support for the people of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and their quest for self-determination and independence. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic is a partially recognized state that claims the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, but controls only the easternmost one-fifth of that territory. President Buhari stated this on Thursday at an audience granted the President of SADR, Brahim Ghali at the State House, Abuja. He stressed that the country’s position is in line with several resolutions of the African Union and the United Nations on the matter, assuring that “Nigeria remains committed to supporting the efforts of the AU and the UN towards finding a lasting solution to the Sahrawi problem.” Earlier, President Ghali had congratulated President Buhari on his re-election and the successful celebration of Democracy Day. He commended Nigeria’s past support for SADR during President Buhari’s tenure as military head of state and the country’s support for liberation movements on the African continent. The SADR leader said the weight of Nigeria’s support remains crucial to the final resolution of the continued colonisation of his people. The Daily Times recalls that Nigeria recognised SADR on November 11, 1984 when General Buhari was head of state.
