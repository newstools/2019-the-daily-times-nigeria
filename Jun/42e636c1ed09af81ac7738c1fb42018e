By Kehinde Akinpelu, Ilorin Another applicant, Olusola Olaseinde is seeking to be joined as co-claimant in the suit challenging the authenticity of the secondary school certificate submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara state. This is just as the Kwara state High Court hearing the case in Ilorin on Monday ruled that the claimant, Abraham Adekunle, has not discontinued with the case. At the sitting of the court, Gov. Abdulrazaq through his counsel, Lawal Jimoh, argued that the claimant has discontinued with the case. He sought to tender a copy of notice of discontinuance said to have been filed by the claimant on May 15, but counsel to the claimant, Oludele Lawrence said that he was not aware of his clientâ€™s intention to discontinue the case. The presiding judge, Adenike Akinpelu, ruled in line with the argument of the counsel to the claimant that the case subsists and was not yet discontinued. The court then proceeded to the application for joinder by Olaseinde the notice of which was filed on June 10 Counsel to Olaseinde, Olawale Babalola, contended that since seven days have lapsed after the filing of the notice, the defendant was out of time to respond to the notice Counsel to the defendant, however, argued that in computing the seven days the day of service was to be excluded making yesterday inclusive of the seven days Justice Akinpelu ruled that June 17 was inclusive of the seven days and held that the defendant was still within the time to respond to the notice and then adjourned the matter to June 26 for further mentioning.
