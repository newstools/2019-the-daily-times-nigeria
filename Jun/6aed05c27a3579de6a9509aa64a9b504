Plateau state Coordinator, National Human Rights Commission, Grace Pam, said understanding the rights of others in society is a sure way to end violent crimes. Speaking at a workshop on human rights organized by a non-governmental organization, Search for Common Grounds (SFCG), for stakeholders in Jos North Local Government Area, Pam said human rights campaigns must be stepped up in communities to address the consequences associated with rights abuse. “To step up this campaign, we are now training school children on the importance of human rights aimed at catching them young so that they will grow up with the mentality formed in them as a culture,” she said Earlier, the Project Coordinator Search for Common Grounds in Plateau state, Patience Chaimang said the workshop is aimed at helping participants understand the essence of respecting other people’s fundamental human rights,. Chaimang said it was important to train stakeholders in early warning signs and conflict transformation which are often triggered by the violation of human rights.
