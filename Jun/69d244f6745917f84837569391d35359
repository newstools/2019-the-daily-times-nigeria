Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Borno state Fire Service, Ambursa Pindar, who confirmed the incident, said that a fire truck was deployed to the scene. Pindar said that the fire destroyed some property, including a jeep that was abandoned in the warehouse, stressing that no life was lost, neither did anyone sustain injury. “We could not ascertain the cause of the fire because nobody was present at the time of the incident. No security men, nobody was present,” he said. He said that machines and equipment belonging to the Maiduguri Flour Mills, owners of the warehouse were also not affected, saying that only the part being utilised by PCNI was affected by the fire.
