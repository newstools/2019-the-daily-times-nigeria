Nosa Akenzua, Asaba A chieftain of the All Progress Congress Party (APC) in Delta state, Chief James Okeleke and about 7, 000 others have dumped the party for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Okeleke, who spoke to journalists in Ogwashi Uku on Wednesday alongside the other decampees, said that he and his supporters dumped the APC because the party has lost direction and focus. He said that it was clear that the APC was not ready for the 2019 general elections in Delta state, but rather embarked on false a hope of winning the elections. “I am fully back to the PDP family and my supporters moved into the party with me. We are no longer members of the APC family because the party lacks focus. “We are now in PDP to support the good works of Senator Ifeanyi Okowa and we mobilized massively for him; we are fulfilled now working for Deltans and Okowa for the upliftment of the state,” Okeleke said State Chairman of the PDP, Kingsley Esiso in his remarks, assured the decampees of equal opportunities with old members of the party and warned them against engaging in anti- party activities. Esiso said that the failure of the APC at all levels clearly has boosted the interest of its members to dump the party for the PDP, assuring that the PDP has the largest umbrella that will contain all the decampees. He commended Gov. Okowa for the completion of the Ogwashi Uku/ Ubulu Unor Road which was abandoned by the past administration.
