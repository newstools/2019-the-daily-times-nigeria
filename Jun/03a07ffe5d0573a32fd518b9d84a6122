Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja Tiwa Savage’s ex-husband,  Tunji Ibrahim Balogun popularly known as Tee Billz has reacted to the painful defeat suffered by British boxer, Anthony Joshua, to Mexican boxer, Ruiz Jr. Ruiz. Teebillz who could not hide the disappointment attributed the loss to the convenient and rather comfortable Yankee lifestyle of the boxer. According to Teebillz, the boxing champion who is also of Nigerian heritage had lost focus during the course of his ‘flexible’ training. This perception of the former music manager caused him to advice Anthony Joshua on several grounds. For one, he told the boxer not to pitch his training camp in Miami next time. Despite his disappointment and reproof, Teebillz still showed his undying loyalty to the boxer. Meanwhile, former Big Brother Naija housemate, Uriel Ngozi Oputa, who has on many occasions in the past publicly crushed on Anthony Joshua on social media, has also reacted to Joshua’s loss in the fight, which took place last Saturday. Uriel in her post on social media revealed that she will prepare Egusi soup for the boxer to help him get over his loss. “There is no shame in this journey we call life, we are dealt with bumps and Loss. A True Champion continues to move regardless of any obstacle. Baby boy forlife. @anthony_joshua proud of you. Will make you Egusi I dey enter London soon,” she wrote.
