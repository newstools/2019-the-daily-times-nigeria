By Peter Fowoyo Respite, on Thursday came the way of three ex officials of the Nigerian Bar Association, Ikeja branch as a special offences court sitting at Ikeja, Lagos, admitted them to bail in the sum of N500, 000. The ex officials – Adesina Ogunlana and Yinka Faroumbi, who were ex chairmen and a former financial secretary, Aderinola Kappo are to provide  two sureties in like sum, one of whom must own a landed property within the jurisdiction of the court. The judge, Mojisola Dada, while delivering her ruling held that the prosecution failed to provide proof that the defendants, especially the first defendant, tampered with prosecution witnesses. According to the Judge, there was no proof that the defendants jumped administrative bail or that the third defendant gave a fake address to the EFCC. “The allegation that the three defendants jumped administrative bail was not proven, although the first and third defendants said they were not around on the last Friday they were supposed to appear before the EFCC. But, they presented themselves the next Monday for arraignment, despite not being served by the EFCC.” “There is no evidence that shows that the EFCC investigated the claims of the third defendant that she was in an hospital in Badagry on that Friday. The EFCC also failed to produce the second defendant in court for arraignment despite being in EFCC custody up until then.” “Failure to appear on the last Friday should not be sufficient reason to deny them bail but they will not be granted bail on self-recognition.” “The defendants shall remain on temporary bail pending the perfection of their bail within two weeks, failure of which they will be remanded in prison.” Meanwhile the matter has been adjourned till July 3, for commencement of trials. The defendants are standing trials on a 30 count charge bordering on alleged money laundering, stealing, and conspiracy. The trio are accused of conspiring to steal ₦20 million belonging to the NBA.
