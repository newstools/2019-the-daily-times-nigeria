He said the case was reported at Ipaja Police Division by the girl’s mother, adding that the offences contravene the provisions of Section 261 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos state 2015. Chief Magistrate Sule-Amzat ordered the police to send the case file to the state  director of public prosecutions for advice and adjourned the case until July 11.
