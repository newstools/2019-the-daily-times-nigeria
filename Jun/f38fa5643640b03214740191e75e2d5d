Ladesope Ladelokun The Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof Umar Danbatta, has reiterated the need for all Nigerians to be involved in protecting telecom infrastructure across the country. Danbatta made this known at a sensitisation forum focused on the imperative of protecting telecom infrastructure in Sapele, Delta State. He explained that all citizens should see telecom infrastructure as a critical national asset because of the importance of telecoms to the effective delivery of services in all other sectors of the economy. In a paper presented by Venny Eze-Nwabufor, Controller of NCC Port Harcourt Zonal Office, on his behalf, the EVC says the Commission needs the support of all stakeholders towards the protection of telecom infrastructure, which is essentially physical and virtual assets created to telecommunications networks that connect cities, towns and highway. Meanwhile, the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) and the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) have been vociferous about the need for a law that will classify telecom equipment as critical national infrastructure. This, according to them will solve the problem of incessant closure of cell sites by state governments. Also, they appeal to the National Assembly to expedite action on the bill that designates telecom equipment as critical national infrastructure and pass it into law.
