It was an emotional day for a Nigerian priest, Fr Gerald Ani, in far away Switzerland, yesterday June 9th as his parishioners gave him an amazing surprise. It was his 10th year anniversary as the priest in charge of his parish in Lugano, Switzerland, and to make him feel special, his parishioners who are mostly Caucasians, decided to take him back to his roots by singing an Igbo song, Lee M Anya Na Mkpuruobi, during mass.
