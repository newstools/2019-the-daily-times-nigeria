Super Eagles head coach Gernot Rohr has axed the duo of Kelechi Iheanacho and Semi Ajayi from his final 23-man squad to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Iheanacho struggled for regular playing time at English Premier League outfit Leicester City in the 2018-19 season and failed to convince Rohr he is worthy of a place in the final team for the competition. Ajayi was a standout performer for Rotherham United in the Sky Bet Championship but was up against more experienced players who play at bigger clubs. The Super Eagles were held to a 0-0 draw by the Warriors of Zimbabwe in a friendly encounter at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, on Saturday. The 23 players and their officials are expected to fly to Ismaila on Sunday for the final lap of their preparations for the competition. The three-time African champions will face the Terangha Lions in their final friendly match on June 16.
