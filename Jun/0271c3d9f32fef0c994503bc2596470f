Tens of thousands of people have gathered in Hong Kong to mark the 30th anniversary of the crackdown on protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Organisers say 180,000 people took part in a vigil, centred in the city’s Victoria Park. Hong Kong and Macau are the only places in China where people can commemorate the activists killed in 1989. China has never said how many people died in the crackdown, but hundreds are believed to have been killed. Everywhere else in China, the authorities have banned even oblique references to the crackdown, which took place after weeks of mass protests that were tolerated by the government. The numbers gathered in and around the square are estimated to have reached a peak of one million people. Hundreds of security personnel and police were monitoring the square in Beijing on Tuesday.
