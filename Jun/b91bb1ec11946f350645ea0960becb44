By Henry Omunu, Abuja Weeks after the management of National Assembly attempted to deregister journalists covering the parliament, the management has again initiated moves to bar over 100 journalists covering the Senate and House of Representatives from covering the inauguration of the 9th National Assembly on June 11. On Thursday, the National Assembly management issued a circular that only 10 journalists out of the accredited 82 covering the House of Representatives would be allowed access into the gallery to cover the inauguration of the 9th House and election of new presiding officers of the House.The same circular was issued in respect of journalists covering the Senate with only 12 members of the Senate press corps short-listed to cover the inauguration and election of new Senate presiding officers.Traditionally, journalists accredited to cover both chambers of the National Assembly are allowed access to the press gallery to cover the inauguration and subsequent election of presiding officers which is the first legislative assignment of the lawmakers.This practice was observed in the sixth and seventh assemblies as the accreditation  of journalists was done smoothly as more than 25 reporters and camera men were accredited from the Senate and House press corps while others were allowed access into the complex. Immediately after the inauguration and election of presiding officers, movements are no longer restricted to enable reporters and cameramen carry out their duties.But, following the latest circular, it is apparent that reporters and cameramen of some media houses are most likely to be locked out of the complex until the entire proceedings are over.As at press time, moves have been initiated to meet with the National Assembly management to increase the number of slots for journalists that would cover the inauguration as well as to ease the restriction on movement to allow other journalists access into the National Assembly complex.
