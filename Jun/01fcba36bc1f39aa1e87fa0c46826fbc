On Monetary Policy Responses, Economic Intelligence Unit  at Access bank said, “the  Our expectation is that the CBN will maintain the benchmark interest rate at the existing 13.5 per cent against the backdrop of still fragile economic growth. “With no change in the benchmark rate anticipated we expect the CBN to continue the issuance of OMO and stabilisation Securities with focus on sterilizing naira liquidity to reduce USD demand.
