Mathew Dadiya The Middle Belt Forum (MBF) has condemned a statement credited to a group – Middle Belt Conscience Guard (MBCG), which the names of General Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma (rtd), former military governor of old Rivers State, Gen. Zamani Lekwot (rtd) were included in a purported statement accusing President Muhammadu Buhari of “pursuing g an Islamic agenda.” MBF National President, Dr. Bitrus Pogu, in a statement on Wednesday, condemned the act, describing it as an attempt to incite Christians against the Buhari-led Federal Government. He said that while attention of the present government is being focused on combating the dreaded Boko Haram in the North-east zone, the present administration has been demonstrating intensified efforts at battling rampaging Fulani terrorists whose bloodthirsty disposition has brought devastation and anguish the nation. The MBF leader said: “We wish to inform Nigerians and the international community that the Middle Belt peoples are now victims of a conspiracy to subjugate them and disinherit them of their ancestral lands. We are calling on men and women of good conscience to spare no efforts in exposing the ongoing heinous crimes against humanity in a bid to unveil the dark spot of human conscience surrounding the massacres of Nigerians and destruction of communities in the Middle Belt Region and other parts of the country.” He said that the MBF has confidence that history and God is on the side of the just, adding that they remain steadfastly confident that someday, they shall witness an end to these tragedies that have befallen the Middle Belt Region and the nation.
