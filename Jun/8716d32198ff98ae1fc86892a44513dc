Titus Akhigbe, Benin A group under the aegis of One Love Foundation has staged a peaceful protest to demand for the immediate inauguration of the 7th Edo state House of Assembly. Founder of the group, Comrade Patrick Eholor while addressing journalists, appealed to Governor Godwin Obaseki, to ensure the inauguration of the lawmakers-elect without further delay. He said that “we are gathered here today for a peaceful protest to remind the governor of Edo state that the citizens deserve better. We are aware that most of the states have inaugurated their state assemblies. “This is our 7th House, we are hoping that as of now, he (Obaseki) would transmit to the c lerk of the House, so that they can carry out the duty and functionality of democracy, so that the dividends of democracy can reach the people who voted them into power. That is why we have called men and women today who believe in democracy to please appeal to the state governor,” he stated. Eholor advised Gov. Obaseki and whoever he has differences with to “come to a round table to settle it because they cannot use Edo people to settle their issues. We cannot continue to suffer this pain. It is very clear in the 1999 Constitution in Section 105, sub-section 3 that when election is conducted, the people duly elected, that the governor has the right to transmit to the clerk of the House of Assembly so that the people can be sworn in so that they can continue with the business for the people. “The governor is very well read, we are appealing to his conscience that no matter what is going on within him or within the party, he should do the needful and respect the rights of those who voted for him and for those who voted for the House of Assembly members.”
