Okerafor Athanatius, Jalingo The Taraba state University (TSU) chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has called off the strike action embarked upon since April 3 with immediate effect. ASUU Chairman, Dr. Samuel Shikaa disclosed this Friday during an interview in Jalingo. Shikaa further stated that the union resolved to suspend the strike in response to the agreement reached between the union and the state government. He added that the strike was also called off owing to a directive from the national headquarters of ASUU, mandating the chapter to call off its strike with immediate effect. The chairman stated that the agreements reached with the state government were considered and approved by the congress. “We were optimistic that government will fulfil its part of the agreement. The implementation has commenced, there are some parts that have been tackled, we are optimistic that they will complete the implementation,” he said. Daily Times reports that a communication from the Vice Chancellor of the Taraba state University, Pro.r Vincent Tenebe asked all students of the university to return back to school for the commencement of lectures. According to our correspondent, ASUU’s demand that led to the strike were the inability of the Taraba state government to pay the academic staff their allowances, payment of pension, perimeter fencing round the university and the issue arising as a result of the staff of the state College of Education, Zing occupying the university’s quarters and some other challenges plaguing the institution.
