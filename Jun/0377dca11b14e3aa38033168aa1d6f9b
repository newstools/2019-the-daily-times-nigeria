As a result, the sector suffered a 7.0 per cent decline in pre-tax profit because of the slow pace of recovery in the economy.” He explained that delay in the passage of 2018 budget and insecurity in some part of the slow part of the country, constrained business operations in those areas, adding that there was also the issue of contraction in yield from federal government debt instruments, which affected accessibility to funds from the bank.

There is a need, therefore, for the federal government to walk the talk by collaborating with our association in ensuring that the environment is conducive for business to thrive. “One of the steps that should be taken is a continuous dialogue with our association and its members. The government should also make strenuous effort to enforce its policy on ease of doing business”, he charged.
