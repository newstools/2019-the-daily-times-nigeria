Ladesope Ladelokun President of the Nigeria Computer Society (NCS), Prof Adebola Aderounmu, has lamented the unfair treatment meted out to local Information and Communications Technology (ICT)  firms by the Federal Government. Aderounmu specifically said they were not accorded the same level of respect as their foreign counterparts, wondering when indigenous ICT firms would begin to be treated as equal with their foreign counterparts. The NCS President, during an interaction with journalists in Lagos, described the Nigerian operating environment as hostile, saying the government has not contributed much to the achievements of local ICT firms. According to Aderounmu, it is disturbing that there is non-compliance of the Federal Government Executive Order on Local content development, adding that local content is yet to be appreciated. Backing his claim with the case of REMITA, an indigenous ICT solution provider, Aderounmu says the Federal Government has failed to fulfil its obligation as far as the services rendered through REMITA software is concerned, describing it as a worrying disrespect for contracts signed with local firms. His words: “Despite official declarations, this in practical terms shows extremely low commitment to the implementation of the ICT Local Content Policy. It does not show much evidence exists of a structured approach to ensure Nigerian ICT firms are prepared by the government to take advantage of emergent national ICT opportunities.” On the forthcoming 14th edition of the NCS International conference, he said:” NCS is preparing for the best and has assembled an impressive line-up of leading researchers, entrepreneurs, educators, industry experts, thought leaders, international scholars and subject matter experts as speakers and resource persons to share their extensive knowledge on the theme and sub-themes.”
