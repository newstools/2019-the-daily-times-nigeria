There should be stronger laws. The society may one day decided to seek for self-help… carry out Jungle Justice on paedophile. The little girl is responding to treatment in an undisclosed Clinic. We will be traveling to Rivers State to meet with the victim and family to offer our support and clear medical bills.We are assuring Nigerians perpetrator will be arrested. #StrongerLaws Share to your law makers.. They have a great role to play. Gwamnishu Emefiena Harrison
