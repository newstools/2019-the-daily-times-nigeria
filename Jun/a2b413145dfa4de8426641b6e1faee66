By Val Okara, Owerri The Imo state House of Assembly on Wednesday directed the state Governor, Emeka Ihedioha to probe his predecessot, Owelle Rochas Okorocha for alleging using N5 billion state funds to build a private university A member representing Aboh Mbaise State Constituency, Eddy Obinna, who sponsored the motion alleged that after building the Eastern Palm University, Ogboko with state resources, Okorocha appointed his personal staff as the vice chancellor. Describing the development as worrisome, Obinna, said that the true status of the university is “shrouded in mystery and secrecy. “When the licence as a university was issued by the National Universities Commission, it became Eastern Palm University, Ogboko and the former Governor, Rochas Okorocha personally received the licence as governor. “As at today, the true ownership of the university is shrouded in mystery and secrecy, but unofficially, the former governor has claimed that a private investor (Rochas Foundation) owns 90 per cent of the university while Imo state government owns 10 per cent. “We should therefore, urge the governor to verify the legal status of the university at Ogboko. Verify the true ownership of the university at Ogboko. Verify the actual financial involvement and investment made by the Imo state government. “Also, the governor should verify whether any third party contributed to the university’s establishment and building and to recover the university for Imo state government if it is established that it was actually built with Imo state funds.” The Speaker, Chiji Collins, who put the motion to a voice vote, ruled that the motion was unanimously adopted by lawmakers.
