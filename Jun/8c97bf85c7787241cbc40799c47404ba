The police on Monday docked an applicant, Sodiq Olubisi, at an Ikeja Magistrate Court for allegedly being in possession of a firearm and belonging to a cult. Olubisi, 31, resides in Ajegunle, Lagos and is charged with conspiracy, cultism and unlawful possession of firearm. He however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Prosecuting police officer, Peter Nwangwu, said that Olubisi committed the offences on April 14 at 2.20 p.m. at Ojo Road, Ajegunle. Nwangwu said the defendant was caught with one single-barrel locally-made gun and one cartridge, disclosing that the defendant also belonged to a cult group called Koyokosere confraternity, which has been proscribed as an unlawful society by the federal government. Nwangwu said the defendant was raided by the police, having received an intelligence report and that he could not give satisfactory account of how he got the gun. He said the offences contravened Sections 42, 330 (d) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos state, 2015. Chief Magistrate, Mrs. Yewande Aje-Afunwa, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N200, 000 with one surety. Aje-Afunwa said the surety should be gainfully employed and should show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos state government. She thereafter, adjourned the case until July 25 for mention.
