The office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) on Friday took over the alleged N25 billion fraud case filed against the former Gombe state Governor, Danjuma Goje from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). For almost eight years, the EFCC has been prosecuting the former governor until Friday, when the case which is before Justice Babatunde Quadiri of the Jos Federal High Court II and has even gone to the Court of Appeal was taken over by the attorney general’s office. The appellate court is yet to fix a date for the hearing of the appeal. When the case up for an emergency hearing before Justice Quadiri, the EFCC counsel, Wahab Shittu, told court that the anti-graft agency was withdrawing from the case and handing it over the office of the attorney-general of the federation for continuation. “My Lord, this case was earlier adjourned for June 20 for continuation of hearing, but then we are here today on the latest development on the matter. We as EFCC counsels are withdrawing from the matter and handing it over to the office of the attorney-general for continuation with the prosecution. “As you can see, in court today is a state counsel from the attorney general’s office to formally take over this case from us, “Shittu declared. Responding, counsel to Sen. Goje, Paul Erokoro (SAN) said he is not objecting to the EFCC withdrawal and handing over of the case to the attorney-general, saying “my Lord, we not objecting to the anti-graft withdrawal and handing over the prosecution to the attorney general’s office.” Counsel from the office of the attorney general, Pius Asika, however, announced his appearance for the case and then applied for an adjournment to enable him prepare for the case proper. Justice Quadiri then adjourned to case to June 21 for continuation of hearing.
