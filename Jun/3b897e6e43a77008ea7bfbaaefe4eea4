Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja Critic, Daddy Freeze has faulted the method of evangelism used by Nigerian billionaire, Cosmas Maduka on the street of Lagos. A had video surfaced on Twitter, posted by Reno Omokri, in which the billionaire was seen preaching in a Lagos street. Omokri then wrote: “This is Cosmas Maduka, CEO of Coscharis Motors. Worth $800 million. An evangelist. He does not collect tithes or owns private jets. But, he evangelizes in the streets”. However, reacting to the development, Freeze said Maduka was doing a good thing, but faulted the efficacy of the method of evangelism, which he said contributed noise to the environment. “He is doing a good thing no doubt. However, in 2019, I am doubtful of the efficacy of this method. “Can you really win souls for Christ like this? I won’t say its noise pollution in an already noisy environment though,” Freeze said.
