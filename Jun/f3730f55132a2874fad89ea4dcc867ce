Kingsley Chukwuka, Jos A member of the Plateau state House of Assembly, Mohammed Balo, has called on politicians to consider nation building above party, religion and ethnic divide as it is only then that the country will reach the Promised Land. Balo representing Qua’an-Pan South Constituency of Plateau state said all those elected into political office should remember that the progress and unity of the country is greater than individual gains. The All Progressive Congress (APC) state assembly member, who spoke to our correspondent in Jos, on the event of the national Democracy Day, assured Nigerians that the future is very bright considering the policies of government in terms of the fight against corruption and economic recovery. “June 12 is victory for all Nigerians and for the ruling party to excel is also the collective hard work of the good citizens of our countrymen. “I believe that this present government will touch the lives of people in a positive way; however, I call on technocrats to approach governance with positive contributions that will grow the country and deepen democracy. “Irrespective of party affiliations, religion, tribe and ethnicity, all those elected into office should come together and work for the common goal of the nation,” he said.
