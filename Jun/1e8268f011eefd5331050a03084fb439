The United States President Donald Trump has revealed that America and the United Kingdom have the “greatest alliance the world has ever known. Speaking during a news conference with Theresa May, the prime minister said that  they had a “great relationship” that they should “build on”. According to May, They both  “openly” discussed their differences, basically on climate change and business with Huawei. On his part, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged Trump to “think about peace” as he addressed protesters in Westminster. As the two leaders paid tribute to the “special relationship”, president  Trump promised a “phenomenal” trade deal after the UK leaves the EU, suggesting it could double or treble trade. Asked if the NHS could be included in a future trade deal, Mr Trump said “everything is on the table”. Meanwhile,  May has revealed that any agreement between the two countries would follow talks about “what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future”.
