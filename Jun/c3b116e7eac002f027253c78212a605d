Doosuur Iwambe Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected president fainted after court session and died afterwards. According to state media, Egypt’s former President Morsi died after appearing in court, “He was speaking before the judge for 20 minutes then became very animated and fainted. He was quickly rushed to the hospital where he later died,” a judicial source said. Morsi, 67, became Egypt’s first democratically elected president in 2012 after the 2011 Arab Spring saw the end of President Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year rule. He was then deposed following mass protests and a military coup in July 2013. He served just one year of a four-year term, while the organization to which he belonged, the Muslim Brotherhood, has since been outlawed. The Cairo Criminal Court had adjourned the trial of Morsi and 23 others in the case of “collaborating with Hamas” for tomorrow. In November 2016, the Court of Cassation scrapped the life imprisonment sentence for Morsi and 21 other defendants, including some who had received the death penalty, in the same case, and ordered a retrial.
