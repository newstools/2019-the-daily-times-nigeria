Dr Niyi Sumonu, the National Coordinator of Congress of University Academics (CONUA), says the union is holding the Federal Government in trust in respect of enrollment of its members into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). Sumonu, while speaking with newsmen on Wednesday in Osogbo, expressed the hope that the enrollment of CONUA members in IPPIS would ensure prompt and constant payment of salaries. CONUA is a splinter group of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).

Sunmonu said the union also believed that all the problems highlighted by the union at a meeting with the Finance Minister in respect of enrollment of CONUA members into IPPIS would be addressed. ” We resolved in our congress over the weekend that all our members should comply with IPPIS registration and they have started enrolling. “We are giving government the benefit of the doubt that the IPPIS enrollment will ensure constant, correct and prompt payment of our salaries, ” Sumonu said. Besides, he said enrollment of lecturers into IPPIS would help to fight corruption in the university system. “There is no doubt that the enrollment of universities into IPPIS is a tool to fight corruption,” Sumonu said.
