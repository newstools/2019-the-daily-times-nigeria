World number eight Rose, who is going for a hat-trick of wins at the tournament after victories in 2017 and 2018, finished with three successive birdies to sit at five under “I birdied the last three holes to turn an OK day into a good day,” Rose told the European Tour. “The hot finish puts me in a great spot to build into tomorrow.” Countryman Danny Willett and Scotland’s Scott Jamieson also posted rounds of 67. English trio Matthew Southgate, Tyrrell Hatton and Aaron Rai are a further stroke back, alongside Scotland’s Richie Ramsay.
