Ayorinde told the court that the defendant committed the offence in August between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. at his residence. Ayorinde alleged that the defendant lured the two sisters into his room and defined them. He submitted that the girls’ mother reported the case at the police station and the defendant was apprehended. News Agency of Nigeria reports that the offence contravenes Section 137 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State 2015, (Revised) and stipulates life imprisonment on conviction.
