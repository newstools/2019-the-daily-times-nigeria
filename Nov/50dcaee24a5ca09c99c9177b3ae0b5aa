The Edo Chapter of the All Progressives Congress  (APC) on Thursday rejected the alleged suspension of the state chairman of the party, Mr Anselm Ojezua by the National Working Committee. This is contained in a statement issued in Benin by the State Assistant Secretary of the party, Mr Anthony Ikhuenobe. Ikhuenobe described the decision of the NWC as bias considering the speed at which it accepted the unconstitutional attempt by some members of the state working committee to remove the state chairman of the party. “They were sponsored and supervised by the National Chairman of APC without recourse to the state Executive Committee.
