Abuja – Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Sen. Solomon Adeola has said that the Finance Bill was not only about Value Added Tax (VAT). He said that it was a composite bill seeking amendment  in seven Acts of the National Assembly with removal of taxes for some sectors in the economy contrary to popular sentiment about the executive bill being about increase in VAT. Mr Kayode Odunaro, Media Adviser to Adeola made this known in a statement in Abuja on Sunday. He said that the bill targeted at reforming the tax regime would involve amendments of seven Acts of the Parliament; Petroleum Profit Tax, Customs and Excise Tariff Act, Company Income Tax Act, Personal Income Tax Act, Value Added Tax, Stamp Duties Act and Capital Gain Tax. “Studying the executive bill that was referred to my Committee after passing second reading on the floor of the senate, I realised that there are lot of ignorance and limited knowledge of the content and import of the Finance Bill.

Meanwhile, the public hearing on the bill is slated for Tuesday, 19.(NAN)
