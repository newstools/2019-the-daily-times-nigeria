The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Dosunmu presented the sum of N1.60 billion as fiscal proposal, with N1.50 billion as capital expenditure and N95.7 million as current expenditure. Dosunmu explained that the scheme would provide healthcare services to those in formal and informal sectors through pooling of resources and purchase of services among others. He added that an indigent scheme for the less privileged would also be provided through equity fund to be made available by the state government.
