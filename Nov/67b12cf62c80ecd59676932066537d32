Jos – An Upper Area Court sitting in Kasuwan Nama, Jos, on Friday, sentenced an 18-year-old man, Adamu Saidu, to five years in prison for stabbing a man who was celebrating with his football team after winning a match. The Judge, Mr Lawal Suleiman, sentenced Saidu after he pleaded guilty to causing grievous hurt and begged the court for leniency. Suleiman, however, gave the  convict an option to pay a fine of N100,000. He also ordered the convict to pay N5,000 to the complainant, Gali Khali.
