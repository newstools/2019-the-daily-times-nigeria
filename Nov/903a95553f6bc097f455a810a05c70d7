He will be here today and we will take a look at him and if there is a problem he will also return to his club,” Dalic revealed. Cagliari midfielder Marko Rog has been called up to the squad to cover for Rakitic, whilst Hajduk defender Josip Juranovic joins the squad to cover for Mitrovic. Croatia needs one point to guarantee qualification for EURO 2020, but coach Dalic says they will be seeking all three points on Saturday. “We are not going for a point, we must seek victory. We must not be overwhelmed by the result in Slovakia (4-0),” said Dalic.
