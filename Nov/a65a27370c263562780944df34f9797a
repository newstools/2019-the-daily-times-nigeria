Abuja – A group of protesters on Wednesday went to the National Assembly to demand for withdrawal of the bills on hate speech and social media. Deji Adeyanju, a civil activist who led the protesters to the National Assembly gate described the bills as “obnoxious”. The protesters carried placards bearing various inscriptions aimed at rejecting the bills. According to Adeyanju, the bills are completely out of place having no place in a democracy regime. ”These bills have no place in our laws and nation because the Cybercrime Act of 2015 has already aptly captured the provisions of these bills in its entirety.
