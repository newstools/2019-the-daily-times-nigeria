Wushishi (Niger) –  Alhaji Suleiman Zungeru, the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Wushishi Local Government Area of Niger, has called on the state government to ensure the completion of the Wushishi-Zungeru electrification project.

The chairman said that the contractor’s negligence would not speak well of the current APC-led administration in the state, hence the need for government to wade in. Zungeru, however, commended Gov. Abubakar Bello, for awarding contract for the construction of Zungeru township road which has reached an advance stage and urged him to do more in improving the infrastructure deficit in the state.
