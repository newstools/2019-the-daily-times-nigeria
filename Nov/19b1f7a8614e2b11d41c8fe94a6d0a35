Danny Rose has revealed he will leave Tottenham at the end of his contract in 18 months – but insists he is going nowhere before then.

I respect that. We move on. “My contract is up in 18 months’ time and I’ll leave the football club then. People can save their time trying to get stuff ready for January about me being sold because I can tell you now; it isn’t happening. “I know what people were trying to do in the summer; there were no bids that was rubbish.” Rose’s stance creates a further headache for Tottenham, who already stand to lose Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld for free at the end of the season. The 29-year-old says he has no issue with Mauricio Pochettino, who is under pressure with Spurs 14th in the Premier League
