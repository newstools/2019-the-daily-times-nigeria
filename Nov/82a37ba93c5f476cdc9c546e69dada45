President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi State on his re-election in the Nov. 16 gubernatorial poll. The President, in a statement by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Monday, described the election and emergence of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate as “a race well run and a victory well won.” He commended APC supporters for remaining steadfast and resolute even in the “face of isolated incidents of violence”. President Buhari condoled with families and loved ones of those who lost their lives as a result of regrettable acts of violence by thugs doing the bidding of their political sponsors. “All political actors and stakeholders must take deliberate steps to eschew electoral violence as a peaceful and orderly process is vital to our quest for enduring democracy,’’ he said.
