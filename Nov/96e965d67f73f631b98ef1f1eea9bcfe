He particularly urged state governments to rise up to their responsibilities, noting that “we are yet to see state governments making strong commitmentsin terms of counterpart funding for serious public health responses. “Many states had left the fight for federal government alone; HIV infection could be anywhere, not only in Abuja.” Nwakamma then called on state governments to commit a percentage of their security vote to the fight against HIV and other health matters.
