APC to politicians: Stop campaign for 2023 presidency, allow Buhari concentrate on good governance Olorunshaye said that between the month of April and October 2019, the defendants and four others now at large conspired and presented themselves as herbalists, who  specialise in ”doubling money”. He alleged that the defendants and their gang fraudulently deceived the brothers to give them five million with a promise to double the amount to N50 million. The prosecutor said that the defendants were arrested during a sting operation, while trying to collect more money from the complainants in Maraba Area, Ilorin. He alleged that other suspects took to their heels. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 97 of  the Penal Code and Section 1(3) of Advance Fee Fraud and other Related Offences Act 2006. The defendants pleaded not guilty as charged. (NAN)
