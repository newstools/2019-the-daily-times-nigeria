Leicester ( UK) – Jamie Vardy and James Maddison struck second-half goals as Leicester City beat an unimpressive Arsenal 2-0 at the King Power Stadium on Saturday to move into second place in the Premier League. Leicester have 26 points and are above Chelsea on goal difference, leading champions Manchester City by a point ahead of their trip to leaders Liverpool on Sunday. Arsenal had a 55th-minute effort from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ruled out for offside after a VAR review and 13 minutes later Leicester struck.
