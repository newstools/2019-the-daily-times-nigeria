Mamora made the assertion during a courtesy visit by a team from the Rotary Club International and Rotary Action Group for population and Development (RFPD), who intimated him of their efforts on partnering with government to ensure reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality in the country. He explained that the MPDSR was an integral part of quality care, which the ministry in collaboration with other stakeholders have developed as a national strategy based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) multi-stakeholder led quality of care. He noted that it was a strategy for medical audit for maternal and perinatal deaths geared at identifying the cause of deaths as well as devising means to prevent reoccurrence. The minister stated that the Federal Government remains committed to ensuring that its efforts towards the reduction in maternal and neonatal mortality indices in Nigeria was rewarding. He expressed with regrets at the current maternal and neonatal mortality ratios of 576/100,000 and 37/1000 live births respectively in Nigeria. The minister said these were unacceptable and stated the commitment of the government to change the narrative. According to him, we acknowledge that we have not had good indices in Nigeria and this calls for the need to step up our efforts. The minister commended the contributions of the Rotary in the area of polio eradication and urged them not to relent in their current efforts directed at the reduction in maternal and neonatal mortality. Mamora expressed government continuous partnership and collaboration with the organisation towards attaining the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality in the country.

He announced that two tranches of the funds have been disbursed to Some States, in addition to various ongoing interventions by the Ministry. Mashi said it was hoped that when these funds were put in full operation, the indices would rely improve. Speaking on the issue of server, interface and administration raised by the visiting team, the Permanent Secretary further assured that government was ready to take over the e-platforms as and when due. He added that it had a dedicated ICT company, Galaxy Backbone that provides services to government Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs).
