Police officials blame Naxals for planting the bomb. “We are trying to ascertain whether this was an improvised explosive device (IED) blast or some other bomb,’’ the police official said. Currently, Naxals are active in more than a third of India’s 600 odd districts across central and eastern India. Indian former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once termed the Naxalite movement as India’s greatest internal security challenge. New Delhi has deployed several companies of its paramilitary forces to take on Naxals in their strongholds.
