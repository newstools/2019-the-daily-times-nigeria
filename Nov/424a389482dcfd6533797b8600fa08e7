A woman was sorely disappointed when she asked her tailor to make her a lovely dinner gown, only to get something that isn’t even fit to be used as a nightgown. The woman said she showed the tailor a photo of what she wanted and the tailor was the one who picked out the material herself. But the material and the style were a far cry from the original dress she was asked to recreate. “My dinner is supposed to be this evening you guys. Before you say I didn’t give the designer the right material, she bought it herself,” the disappointed customer wrote as she shared photos of her botched dinner gown. See more photos below of what the customer asked for vs what she got.
