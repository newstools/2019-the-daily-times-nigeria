Mr Ketil Karlsen, the Head of European Union delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, said that the union would continue to discuss with Nigerian government on the best way to handle migration issues. According to Karlsen, the world will continue to experience migration provided there is continuity in human existence. “It is not ordinary to leave your family for a different continent if not that you are searching for something, there will always be migration as long as people need to work. “But in all these, we have quite a number of irregular migration from Nigeria, I will love to celebrate because the number has gone down,” he said. He however appreciated the contribution of Nigerian migrants, particularly those in search of medical jobs, saying they brought positive development to other countries. (NAN)
