Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva has been banned for one
match and fined £50,000 after an FA commission accepted he “did not
intend” a tweet about team-mate Benjamin Mendy to be “racist”. Silva compared Mendy to the character on a packet of Conguitos a chocolate brand available in Spain and Portugal.

before tweeting: “Can’t even joke with a friend these days.” The FA report said: “Many persons would have taken
offence to the content.” It added: “The player did not himself intend the post
to be insulting or in any way racist. It is clear that the tweet was intended
to be no more than a joke between close friends. “However, this was not a private communication between
two friends. “The post was on a social media platform exposed to the
600,000 followers of a high-profile and well-respected professional footballer. “Many persons viewing the imagery depicted in the tweet
would have taken offence to the content as being insulting by reference to
race, colour and ethnic origin in a way that unquestionably brings the game of
football into disrepute.” Sterling defends Silva over Mendy tweet Silva is an “exceptional person” – Guardiola The Portugal forward, 25, must also complete a face-to-face
education for his Tweet on 22 September, after admitting a breach of FA Rule
E3. There was no hearing after Silva admitted the initial charge
on 2 October, acknowledging some people may be offended by the “historical
connotations of the Conguitos character”. The FA commission also say they received a letter written by
Mendy in support of his team-mate. Silva will be ineligible for City’s Premier League home
match against Chelsea on Saturday, 23 November (17:30 GMT).
