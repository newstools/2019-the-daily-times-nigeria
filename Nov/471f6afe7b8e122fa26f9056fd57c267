As you’d expect, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo both make the cut in attack. Having shared the Ballon d’Or for some many years, the icon duo start in a three-pronged attack, with nine Champions League titles between them. Whilst Messi’s have all come with Argentina, one of Ronaldo’s came with Manchester United and the other four at Real Madrid. Joining the duo in attack is former Arsenal and Barcelona striker Thierry Henry. The Frenchman lost the 2006 final with the Gunners to the Catalan giants before moving over to Spain. Henry was selected in the Team of the Year five times including in the first four teams consecutively. There is room for another ex-Premier League star in the XI and that is Steven Gerrard. The Red captain was a key member of the side that completed the famous comeback in Istanbul in 2005 to lift the Champions League trophy. Gerrard was selected in the Team of the Year on three separate occasions throughout his time with Liverpool. To round off the team, there are five current or former Barcelona stars in the selection, Messi joined by Andreas Iniesta, Xavi, Gerard Pique, who also won the trophy once with Manchester United and three times with the Catalans, plus Carles Puyol. Casillas is in goal thanks to six selections in the Team of the Year, while Ramos is the most selected defender with eight. He is joined at the back by Pique (five), Puyol (six) and Bayern Munich and ex-Bayern Munich left-back Philipp Lahm (five).
