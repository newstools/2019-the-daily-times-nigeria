That´s nonsense,” Zinedine Zidane said. “People can talk about me, about what I do, but nobody can put fake words on my mouth. “Of course, we cannot have the same bond with everybody but I´ve never had any problem with Gareth, even after what happened during last summer when supposedly he was leaving. “This is the situation: he´s here, and I´m happy because the player is very good.” “So yes, I want Gareth to stay here with us until the end of the season. That’s very clear.”
