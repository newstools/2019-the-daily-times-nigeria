Apple has banned an app that let people monitor others’ activity on Instagram. The action comes a month after Instagram had tried to force the app to shut down after accusing it of scraping people’s data without their consent. Like Patrol’s Mexico-based developer insists the app merely utilised public data and Sergio Luis Quintero told the BBC that he now plans to challenge Apple’s ban. “We plan to appeal this decision in the coming days,” he said. He added that he also intended to make Like Patrol’s code open source so that others could reproduce its functionality. Mr Quintero had described Like Patrol as being a version of the tab “on steroids”. “Great tool to keep track of my teenagers… without them thinking I’m being nosy,” read one review on Apple’s App Store. But several technology blogs said it encouraged ”creepy behavior.” Instagram itself said the software had violated its policies.

So, in theory, Like Patrol could continue serving its existing members.” “This app may well be gone but there are undoubtedly many more still out there,” said Lisa Forte, founder of Red Goat Cyber Security. “Our data and privacy is valuable. Apps like this one can be hugely intrusive. “Be very cautious with what apps you decide to download and always keep your phone updated.”
