Diah said that the judgment did not come as a surprise, adding that the appellate court only affirmed the decision of Taraba masses who turned out en masse for the re-election of Ishaku. He assured the people of the state that the governor would reciprocate their gesture by consolidating on the achievement he has recorded in his first tenure.
