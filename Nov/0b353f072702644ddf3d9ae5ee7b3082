OPL 212: Supreme Court orders NNPC to pay N8.14bn in damages to BCE Tinubu described the former minister as a leader of substance, whose voice regularly cautioned the leadership against unconstitutionality, adding that his intellectual pedigree would be sorely missed. “Somebody who served as minister under Muhammadu Buhari as military leader and won his respect and admiration must be a man of integrity and honesty. “I mourn with his family, both immediate and extended. I mourn with the people of Buguma, Kalabari Kingdom, the government and people of Rivers State and Nigeria, which he served selflessly. “My prayer is that God Almighty grants him eternal rest. I also hope and pray that his good legacies will continue to endure,” he said.
