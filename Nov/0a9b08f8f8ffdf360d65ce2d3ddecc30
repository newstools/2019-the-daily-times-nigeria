Following a series of successful seasons in the past 12 years of operations, SPAN has continued to bridge the gap between performing arts education and presentation through missions and messages that have resonated through social and artistic challenges. In view of this SPAN have revealed the theme for the 2019/2020 season tagged ‘Your Success, Our Victory’ at a well attended media parley held recently. SPAN has continued to bridge the gap between performing arts education and presentation through missions and messages that have resonated through social and artistic challenges. The impact of SPAN has stretched beyond socio-economic class, tribe or religion as the benefit of engaging the grassroots’ audience with performing art education, entertainment and transforming messages has remained our core drive. Speaking on the rationale behind this message, Sarah Boulos, the Chairperson of SPAN, further stated, “I have realized that some of the barrier to our individual victory does not necessary mean our direct effort at something, but the effort at ensuring the other person succeeds. Victory should now be attributed to more than just our wins but also helping the other person win and our winning together.” In addition to this, she said, “Focusing on helping someone succeed, can also assure your victory, and that poverty alleviation will be one of our emphases, using empowerment community programs and performing arts as a tool, starting from November 11, 2019.
