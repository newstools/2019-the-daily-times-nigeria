Mr. Idris Giwa, the PW 12 from GTB tendered Air Vice Marshall Mohammed Dikko Umar personal  opening account packages and two other companies linked to him –  Multiple Bridge Limited and UND Limited probably to show that his total earnings were far below the amount allegedly traced to him. Though Umar is yet to open his defence, source close to his administration told the Daily Times the money for which he is being prosecuted for “was what Umar used to execute the laudable projects for which he is known in the Nigerian Air Force. They were used to reactivate and maintain aircrafts for which no funds are released from the normal budgets.” The source added that part of the money was “used for training programmes including pilot training, which reached a height under his watch. Remember that it was in the process that the Nigerian Air Force got the first female combat pilot.”
